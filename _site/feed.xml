                <description>&lt;p&gt;Main events points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it all stared when pramod asked what are you doing on weekend, i said nothing, so he invited me for a small hike. tures out the booking was full and one of their frriend backed out, so i replaced her. gpayed her the booking amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;started at 5am in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;went to my friend pramods place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;went to BMC office with pramod by auto at 5:30 am&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;met dilruba and new people on the bus, we were 37 people for the trek.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;started the journey, some people joined at outer of bangalore, i saw a foreigned girl also boarded the bus,i gave a long thought should i interact with her on the trek or leave it, then i thought she must be already getting all the unwanted attention and typical boys must be over helping her, so i ditched the plan to be another irritating boy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pretty dark in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;took a small nap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bus halted for breakfast at —&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it was 7 am in the morning ans we were ~80-100 km from bangalore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after having my breafast, i stepped outside if the restaurent, which was on the highway ti self&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;saw many riders pass by on the highway, hit some nostalgia, and my urge to have a bike ride&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i have been on this road with bmw biker group for a breakfast ride 1 month back&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the road is pretty smooth like butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the view, the curves, the lush greenry along the road, and some mountains that you can see far away will make you sing “country road, take me home, to the palce whiere i belong country road”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while i was watching the bikers pass by on their touring bikes, some himalyan, 650 interceptor, aand many bmws, ktm adventures, i realised i m not the only biker on the bus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon few of us started talking about bikes, and the places they have been around banaglore with their bikes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we started music on the bus, its about 8ish am in the morning, after that the dancing enthu if dilruba made everyone on their toes. we danced for 2 hours on the bus while its doing 100kmph.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i realied i should take some rest, i havet hiked lately and i should conserve my energy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to take some rest, i sat on a seat next to a guy who seems very clam personality. moinding his own business. he hasnt spoken anything till now, atleast i havent seen him talk. though he seemed irritated by the loud music in the bus banging next to his ear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;he was simply wathcin the outside the window, embracing the sunlight and the greenry and forest on our way. (entire sourht indian roads are really green, so you can enjoy the landscape it will always leave you in awe)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 5 min or so, i saw he took out his iphone, and expensive model, started scrolling through his pictures, i peeked them too (i know nobosy should), i realised they were really good, mosly of landscape where there is the grass is like 1 feet and they are full of flowers, wnother phot contins a transparent blue lake, surrounded by 3-4 grey rocky mountains. another was someone walking in wallpaper that you have seen on windoex xp wallpaper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;he just keept scorlling, zooming in to some of the, admiring the nature (that he has been to, i pressumed)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;since i have been to a similar trek, i felt nostalgic too. and i couldnt resist, and said ‘pretty nostalgic huh?’, and our conversation started, and i just saw bright energy on his while he started telling me about his trek, it was from valley of flowers, he told me he’s from kashmir, and has been to many places, and how the trek was. pretty meshmeriseing, just imagining the path, the views, igot chills. i thought of geeting there one day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;turned out he was also a chemicla engineer and into core plant designing….and typical discussion around the industry….&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;now i can see the bus is in the mountian curves, so i took out my action camera to start recording the view, attched below&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon at 1pm we reached our base, kukke subraminiya. they dropped us at a hotel, wehere we are supposed to freshen up. 5 people in a room to get changed. well i presummed we were gonna start the trek as soon as we debaord the bus, so i was all set up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then went to our lunch place we everyone had some form of rice and some drinks. there was a famous temple as well, but we were late so we were told to head for the bus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the bus then took us 2km, and dropped us at our starting point for trek.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there were some guides, i wasnt sure who were the guides, i remeber someone in rest sweatshirt, i didnt know any of their name.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then him ,a dn another girl in blue tshirt were distributing food in paper packets, it was breakfast for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so we had clothes for 2 days, breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;everyone got into pair of two, aditoanally everyone have to carry their sleeping bags and tents, so 2 sleepng bangs and 1 tent for a pair. Me and pramod paired up, i took the tent and he took the sleeping bags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on the starting of the trek we encountered a miliray camp. so here everyone is supposed to get their bags checked, and they count for harmful marterial. and the best part they count the number of plactic items that you are carrying for trek. so the note it down, min was 17+3, 17 (chocolates, polythene, cupos, buscit wrapper etc)+ 3 bottles. there was 100rs secutiry deposite for the plastic. i really like this idea, thiskept me motivated not to litter plastic on the mountain. some people were getting frustrated that it was making them late for the trek etc, but i know they are doing this for good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so its was arounf 45 min process for ~40 people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after this check, we all gsthered, guides did the counting, then gave us instruction…..there i found that we have 3 guides. i still dont know thier names xd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so finaly we started ascending the mountains at 3:30pm sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone filled with enthu stepping into the woods, in 10 mins or so everyone was seggrigate according to their pace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i was kinda in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i can see the the path was not much defined, it was just a 2 feet gap where not much vegetation. sky is completely coverd with canopies. some sunlight can pass through the gaps and creating a diffusion effect. though it was a bright snny dat, 3:30pm, the ground but only few patches of the ground were getting direct sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first 15 min were touch on me, it was steep patch and my body wasnt warm enough, so i sterted feeling exausted. i felt im uot of stamina. and this was just the 15 mi of the trek. we were supposed to do 12hours next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i several people pasover took me in first half an hour. once my body got into the mood, i felt my muscle relaxed, a buzz of energy just got into my, my steps got faster and started enjoting the path.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 30 min or so, i saw some people of my group were taking rest after the steep incline. i joined them. there we had few conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but the goal was to keep moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;halfway there ther was a tree in the middle and a small 2 feel wall around there, and additonal way which heads in the right direction. A, a fellow trekker said our guide went in the right direction. while we just arrived, we dont know where to go, straight or right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we had that girl guide with us as well, it tured out it was her first time on this trek, so she wasnt sure of the direction either.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some said there is a waterfall in the right direction, i was able to hear some water noise as well, but some disagreed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i saw some people coming towards us from the front direction, so i asked where should we head, he said go straight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so me and few other started to mve again in straight direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after half an hour of hike, our guide told us we are at the forefront of our clan, the one batch which was ahead of us went to that right direction for waterfall. we were told to stop as no one is supposed to overtake the guide in the forefront. then we concluded not to wait for them, and keep so that we dont waste time just waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;body was getting tired and every step was a step upwards, the entire trek was steep and jsut up, ther was no path which was horizontal or just flat so that our muscle can relax and recover. I have never wished for something flat before this one, pun indeed xd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the “valley fo flower’ dude(i forgot his name) were moving together, and incetivising each other that we will take sniker bite as reward once we cover some significant part. “thoda aur chal bhai fir chocolate khayenge”, two grown ups, getting happy with just the thought of the delicious chocolate xd, like we are 10 year old.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after ~ 6:00pm 2.5 hour of hiking, finally we passed the dense forest and can see the open sky. and when i looked around, it was marvellous. i told everyone to turn around. it was the time of sun set, the sky was having shades of voilet, orange, and some lemon green. colors spreaded like theu are strokes of brush originating from horison. we were able to see the peak of kumar parvata(that we assumed).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we took a break there, clicked some picture and i finally rewarded my self with a chocolate. hydrated ourselves and started moving again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;now we found some flat xd, only 5 min hike was left till we reach our camping site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zoom zoom, we reached the spot, it was fucking crowded. like 300 people on the top, on the sunset point, kisi ko kaam dhandha nahi hai. fucking 300 people already there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i went to sunset point, streched my legs and set along with 300folks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we all filled a form there, it was dark already, so using torch light whoever reach to campsite filled the form one by one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon others also reache the site, it was dark already. everyone started finding a place to put the tent. we upheld the tent quickly and started looking out other folks from our group. found some of them sitting on a curve, next to the entry point. Guides told us not to move, since it was hard to identify who is from our group and who isnt, since we didnt had any intro or anythoeg, we didnt know other either, apart from the one whom we interatec during the ascend phase. after 20min of here and there we all gathered together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it was 8pm already. we are supposed to take a a plate that we got at the start of the trek and started following a guide, in the dark. after 15 min of walking in the dark we reached our mess spot, where again infi bheed. complete darkness, it was a 40x50feet area and 400ish people are having their dinner, some are waiting for the plate, some were in queue to get the dinner. some who got the plate formed a circle while stading and eating it. some were washing their plate…..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 30 min, we got our food tokens, and we have to remove our shoed to get the food. i was so out of energy that i asked dilruba to get my food, i will watch for her shoes, yeah it is possible that some motherfucker can steal your shoes while you are in the middle of a hike with nowhere to go. later everyone kept their shoe with with me and they went to get food.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our fellow mates were still in the food line, but somehow our guide got 1 plate, it was rice and sambhar with some achar. she offered to share, and i was so hungry i starte eaiting from her plat itself. after a while i realised, i might have had more than 40% of her share. when my plate came wtih dilruba, i offered her, to have some from my plate itslef, she denied, i felt a little bad that i shouldnt have had this much from her plate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after the dinner, people stated moving back to teh campt site. since we moved down hill for mess, we now have to hike up to camp site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some of us gathered and had little chit chat. at 9ish, we all went to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;since there were 700 hikers, and only 4 washroom, we had to wake up early, get shit done, and start the ascend by 4:30am. i got up at 3:30am, saw there was ahuge queue for the washroom, turnes out anothwe trekking group was aiming for 4am hike, so their batch occupied most of the washroom. after freshening up, we all gathered at 4:30am on the same spot as yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;out guides got our instand poha ready and handed over to us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we started the hike, soon after 300meter of hike, there was a checkpost where whatever you are carrying upwards was getting checked. well i appriciate the checkking for plastic etc, but i believe the frisking before hike was bit unnecessary, like dont you trust the lest checkpost people….anyways, it creted a really huge queue along the trek, like for half a kilometer. its was still dark 4:45am, so icould see the trail for lights. and some people who might have started 30 mins before us have reached really far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i just started my phone flashlight, kept in in the waise bag and started ascending. kpet my head down and kept movingnforward. i could se many people sat on the aile side of the trek, recovering their energy, mostly group of friends. i knew tht i m a tortoise in these things, so i had to keep moving else it will cost me later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i observed that some of the trails have a steep fall, we are walking in the bushes, mountain on the right, khai on the left. i kept pushing myself, and taking some glance where i was and my surrounding. initially i was able to see the lights of nearest village, then later they got lost too, since we crossed a mountina, enterd som jungle, maybe moved aroud the mountain, all i could see mountins around me and trail for next 20 feet. someehere around 6:00, the sky started to brightn up, everyone turned down theirs lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon after this, i got around a curve which bends to bit right, we were walking on the edge of a mountain, on the left i can see khai and far away small mountain ranges, which are covered with fog and mist. on the right, it was part of the mountain i was walking on, and at the end, it was clouds, floating over the mountian, something like a snail crawling over a curve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i was looking this from 100m, and soon i reached there too, and mannn the wind speed was soo soo high, i coulnd dare to stand on the edge. but we cant see the horizon was covered with cloud and mist was merged into dark forest woods. as we move our vision further you can see the freen mountain ruing into dark mountain and slowy getting merged with mist, like a things getting dissapeard into the mist. that valley seems like a slide to me, a 5000 feet slide covered with dense forest, and spreading till the the edge pf the horizon. we cant see the floor of the vally, completely coverd wit trees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so it was a point where two mountains meet, and a pass/valley is created. the wind hitting the two mountains side by side creats a funnel effect, where the wind converges and its speed increses enoromusly. something like a ram effect in the jet engine. i stood there for a min to closed my eyes, feeling the high speed wind areting the gushing sound. some of my pther firnds reached withing a min for so. i clicked few pictures, creted timelaps of the c,ouds falling of a clif(yes exacly like a waterfall). i have never seen clouds in this speedy motion before.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can see a cliff form this spot, i thoght finally, 30 min mor of hiking to reach the might kumar parvata. guide kept telling the above is shesh parvat, but i couldnt under stadn which one, coz there were many clifs next to it. socha hoga baju wala shesha parvat hoga, and 100m baki me dikh raha wo kumar parvat hoga.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after reaching the cliff. i sat in relief, that wow, buddy you did it. the cliff was completely covered in cloud(not mist, not fog, clouds). isaw some people going even further, the route goes downwards. i thought must be some small spot nest to it for a better view or something. our guide arrived at the cliff as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while i was happily recoring timelaps, she said, comeon, let keep moving, i m like where? we are alredy on the kumar parvat. then it hit me, son of a bitch, we are on shesha parvat, and, and kumarpart is 1 more hour away. i m like, ho gaya mera.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but itna aaye hain to thoda aur sahi, “seh lenge thoda” xd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so we followed the path path which goes downwards, while on top, there were no trees etc, it was a hill top, when we atared moving downwards, it was a super dense forest. no defined path, and tree branches are everywhere on the path. Imagine a dense forest, where the only marker to move is no grass on the floor. if it had been not used by 2 more days, the grass would have made that path dissapear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i kept walking with vishal while also vloggin on my action camera, this was mosly the decent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after some time we took a break, for others to arrive. we sat on a very steeply inclined rocky path, wide enough that 3-4 people can pass though simultabously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 5 min or so, ther was no cummunicatino from our other team, harash, the guide at the back wasnt responding on walie talki. we we aited a bit more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when everyone reached we got a group picture there. now only 10-15 min of hike was left for kumar parvata.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we arrived at a poitn where it was a 60-70 degree climb. we were climbing on rocks made from volcanic eruption happened millions of year ago, said aditya(now i got his name). you cant see much farther than 10 feet, and it is scary ass climb, and “steep” cant even define that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then there comes a grand entry to the kumar parvata, it seems like a well defined 2 feet path, cut out from a maze made of bushes. a sight of relief.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but there was so much fog, everyone was looking like a zonbie movie character. i swear if someone alone, and someone played the hoirror music there, he might run for his life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on the top, there was a pile of rocks, it s famous structure where everyone clicks piture in sense of achievement. we all got out pics there too. there was a temple at the top as well. only some people whet there, including me. you are supposed to remove shoes first. and dud, the mountain was so cold. it was giving relaxing massage and cold was biting my feet simultanously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we ate our breakfast, and chocolates there. it was cloudy, there, you cant nsee more that 5-10 feet there. plus windy too. overall a very good sensation. we couldnt see anything from the top, but it felt good. i didnt care about the view there, i wa happy that i reached the top. everyone hair was having dew drops in them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we all gathered, guides did our counting, and zoom zoom, we started our way back to the camping site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i told you, i know i will be in pain during decent so i had to take several stops, so started early. our way back was not that foggy. it was 9am already. some of us again struggled to move from kumar parvata to shasha parvat. through the same dense forest, but this time we could see the forest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h2 id=&quot;we-reached-the-shesha-parvat-took-some-break-and-the-view-after-the-clouds-were-gone-was-completely-differnt-now-the-the-shades-of-green-were-differnet-the-dew-on-the-leaves-was-making-the-trees-sparkle-the-chilly-wind-was-adding-cooling-down-the-effect-of-scrotching-sun&quot;&gt;we reached the shesha parvat, took some break. and the view after the clouds were gone was completely differnt. now the the shades of green were differnet, the dew on the leaves was making the trees sparkle. the chilly wind was adding cooling down the effect of scrotching sun.&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Kumar Parvata Trek</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Main events points&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it all stared when pramod asked what are you doing on weekend, i said nothing, so he invited me for a small hike. tures out the booking was full and one of their frriend backed out, so i replaced her. gpayed her the booking amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;started at 5am in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;went to my friend pramods place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;went to BMC office with pramod by auto at 5:30 am&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;met dilruba and new people on the bus, we were 37 people for the trek.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;started the journey, some people joined at outer of bangalore, i saw a foreigned girl also boarded the bus,i gave a long thought should i interact with her on the trek or leave it, then i thought she must be already getting all the unwanted attention and typical boys must be over helping her, so i ditched the plan to be another irritating boy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pretty dark in the morning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;took a small nap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bus halted for breakfast at —&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it was 7 am in the morning ans we were ~80-100 km from bangalore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after having my breafast, i stepped outside if the restaurent, which was on the highway ti self&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;saw many riders pass by on the highway, hit some nostalgia, and my urge to have a bike ride&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i have been on this road with bmw biker group for a breakfast ride 1 month back&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the road is pretty smooth like butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the view, the curves, the lush greenry along the road, and some mountains that you can see far away will make you sing “country road, take me home, to the palce whiere i belong country road”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while i was watching the bikers pass by on their touring bikes, some himalyan, 650 interceptor, aand many bmws, ktm adventures, i realised i m not the only biker on the bus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon few of us started talking about bikes, and the places they have been around banaglore with their bikes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we started music on the bus, its about 8ish am in the morning, after that the dancing enthu if dilruba made everyone on their toes. we danced for 2 hours on the bus while its doing 100kmph.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i realied i should take some rest, i havet hiked lately and i should conserve my energy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;to take some rest, i sat on a seat next to a guy who seems very clam personality. moinding his own business. he hasnt spoken anything till now, atleast i havent seen him talk. though he seemed irritated by the loud music in the bus banging next to his ear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;he was simply wathcin the outside the window, embracing the sunlight and the greenry and forest on our way. (entire sourht indian roads are really green, so you can enjoy the landscape it will always leave you in awe)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 5 min or so, i saw he took out his iphone, and expensive model, started scrolling through his pictures, i peeked them too (i know nobosy should), i realised they were really good, mosly of landscape where there is the grass is like 1 feet and they are full of flowers, wnother phot contins a transparent blue lake, surrounded by 3-4 grey rocky mountains. another was someone walking in wallpaper that you have seen on windoex xp wallpaper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;he just keept scorlling, zooming in to some of the, admiring the nature (that he has been to, i pressumed)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;since i have been to a similar trek, i felt nostalgic too. and i couldnt resist, and said ‘pretty nostalgic huh?’, and our conversation started, and i just saw bright energy on his while he started telling me about his trek, it was from valley of flowers, he told me he’s from kashmir, and has been to many places, and how the trek was. pretty meshmeriseing, just imagining the path, the views, igot chills. i thought of geeting there one day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;turned out he was also a chemicla engineer and into core plant designing….and typical discussion around the industry….&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;now i can see the bus is in the mountian curves, so i took out my action camera to start recording the view, attched below&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon at 1pm we reached our base, kukke subraminiya. they dropped us at a hotel, wehere we are supposed to freshen up. 5 people in a room to get changed. well i presummed we were gonna start the trek as soon as we debaord the bus, so i was all set up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then went to our lunch place we everyone had some form of rice and some drinks. there was a famous temple as well, but we were late so we were told to head for the bus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the bus then took us 2km, and dropped us at our starting point for trek.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there were some guides, i wasnt sure who were the guides, i remeber someone in rest sweatshirt, i didnt know any of their name.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then him ,a dn another girl in blue tshirt were distributing food in paper packets, it was breakfast for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so we had clothes for 2 days, breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;everyone got into pair of two, aditoanally everyone have to carry their sleeping bags and tents, so 2 sleepng bangs and 1 tent for a pair. Me and pramod paired up, i took the tent and he took the sleeping bags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on the starting of the trek we encountered a miliray camp. so here everyone is supposed to get their bags checked, and they count for harmful marterial. and the best part they count the number of plactic items that you are carrying for trek. so the note it down, min was 17+3, 17 (chocolates, polythene, cupos, buscit wrapper etc)+ 3 bottles. there was 100rs secutiry deposite for the plastic. i really like this idea, thiskept me motivated not to litter plastic on the mountain. some people were getting frustrated that it was making them late for the trek etc, but i know they are doing this for good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so its was arounf 45 min process for ~40 people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after this check, we all gsthered, guides did the counting, then gave us instruction…..there i found that we have 3 guides. i still dont know thier names xd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so finaly we started ascending the mountains at 3:30pm sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone filled with enthu stepping into the woods, in 10 mins or so everyone was seggrigate according to their pace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i was kinda in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i can see the the path was not much defined, it was just a 2 feet gap where not much vegetation. sky is completely coverd with canopies. some sunlight can pass through the gaps and creating a diffusion effect. though it was a bright snny dat, 3:30pm, the ground but only few patches of the ground were getting direct sunlight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first 15 min were touch on me, it was steep patch and my body wasnt warm enough, so i sterted feeling exausted. i felt im uot of stamina. and this was just the 15 mi of the trek. we were supposed to do 12hours next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i several people pasover took me in first half an hour. once my body got into the mood, i felt my muscle relaxed, a buzz of energy just got into my, my steps got faster and started enjoting the path.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 30 min or so, i saw some people of my group were taking rest after the steep incline. i joined them. there we had few conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but the goal was to keep moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;halfway there ther was a tree in the middle and a small 2 feel wall around there, and additonal way which heads in the right direction. A, a fellow trekker said our guide went in the right direction. while we just arrived, we dont know where to go, straight or right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we had that girl guide with us as well, it tured out it was her first time on this trek, so she wasnt sure of the direction either.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some said there is a waterfall in the right direction, i was able to hear some water noise as well, but some disagreed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i saw some people coming towards us from the front direction, so i asked where should we head, he said go straight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so me and few other started to mve again in straight direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after half an hour of hike, our guide told us we are at the forefront of our clan, the one batch which was ahead of us went to that right direction for waterfall. we were told to stop as no one is supposed to overtake the guide in the forefront. then we concluded not to wait for them, and keep so that we dont waste time just waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;body was getting tired and every step was a step upwards, the entire trek was steep and jsut up, ther was no path which was horizontal or just flat so that our muscle can relax and recover. I have never wished for something flat before this one, pun indeed xd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the “valley fo flower’ dude(i forgot his name) were moving together, and incetivising each other that we will take sniker bite as reward once we cover some significant part. “thoda aur chal bhai fir chocolate khayenge”, two grown ups, getting happy with just the thought of the delicious chocolate xd, like we are 10 year old.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after ~ 6:00pm 2.5 hour of hiking, finally we passed the dense forest and can see the open sky. and when i looked around, it was marvellous. i told everyone to turn around. it was the time of sun set, the sky was having shades of voilet, orange, and some lemon green. colors spreaded like theu are strokes of brush originating from horison. we were able to see the peak of kumar parvata(that we assumed).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we took a break there, clicked some picture and i finally rewarded my self with a chocolate. hydrated ourselves and started moving again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;now we found some flat xd, only 5 min hike was left till we reach our camping site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zoom zoom, we reached the spot, it was fucking crowded. like 300 people on the top, on the sunset point, kisi ko kaam dhandha nahi hai. fucking 300 people already there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i went to sunset point, streched my legs and set along with 300folks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we all filled a form there, it was dark already, so using torch light whoever reach to campsite filled the form one by one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon others also reache the site, it was dark already. everyone started finding a place to put the tent. we upheld the tent quickly and started looking out other folks from our group. found some of them sitting on a curve, next to the entry point. Guides told us not to move, since it was hard to identify who is from our group and who isnt, since we didnt had any intro or anythoeg, we didnt know other either, apart from the one whom we interatec during the ascend phase. after 20min of here and there we all gathered together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it was 8pm already. we are supposed to take a a plate that we got at the start of the trek and started following a guide, in the dark. after 15 min of walking in the dark we reached our mess spot, where again infi bheed. complete darkness, it was a 40x50feet area and 400ish people are having their dinner, some are waiting for the plate, some were in queue to get the dinner. some who got the plate formed a circle while stading and eating it. some were washing their plate…..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 30 min, we got our food tokens, and we have to remove our shoed to get the food. i was so out of energy that i asked dilruba to get my food, i will watch for her shoes, yeah it is possible that some motherfucker can steal your shoes while you are in the middle of a hike with nowhere to go. later everyone kept their shoe with with me and they went to get food.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our fellow mates were still in the food line, but somehow our guide got 1 plate, it was rice and sambhar with some achar. she offered to share, and i was so hungry i starte eaiting from her plat itself. after a while i realised, i might have had more than 40% of her share. when my plate came wtih dilruba, i offered her, to have some from my plate itslef, she denied, i felt a little bad that i shouldnt have had this much from her plate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after the dinner, people stated moving back to teh campt site. since we moved down hill for mess, we now have to hike up to camp site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some of us gathered and had little chit chat. at 9ish, we all went to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;since there were 700 hikers, and only 4 washroom, we had to wake up early, get shit done, and start the ascend by 4:30am. i got up at 3:30am, saw there was ahuge queue for the washroom, turnes out anothwe trekking group was aiming for 4am hike, so their batch occupied most of the washroom. after freshening up, we all gathered at 4:30am on the same spot as yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;out guides got our instand poha ready and handed over to us.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we started the hike, soon after 300meter of hike, there was a checkpost where whatever you are carrying upwards was getting checked. well i appriciate the checkking for plastic etc, but i believe the frisking before hike was bit unnecessary, like dont you trust the lest checkpost people….anyways, it creted a really huge queue along the trek, like for half a kilometer. its was still dark 4:45am, so icould see the trail for lights. and some people who might have started 30 mins before us have reached really far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i just started my phone flashlight, kept in in the waise bag and started ascending. kpet my head down and kept movingnforward. i could se many people sat on the aile side of the trek, recovering their energy, mostly group of friends. i knew tht i m a tortoise in these things, so i had to keep moving else it will cost me later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i observed that some of the trails have a steep fall, we are walking in the bushes, mountain on the right, khai on the left. i kept pushing myself, and taking some glance where i was and my surrounding. initially i was able to see the lights of nearest village, then later they got lost too, since we crossed a mountina, enterd som jungle, maybe moved aroud the mountain, all i could see mountins around me and trail for next 20 feet. someehere around 6:00, the sky started to brightn up, everyone turned down theirs lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon after this, i got around a curve which bends to bit right, we were walking on the edge of a mountain, on the left i can see khai and far away small mountain ranges, which are covered with fog and mist. on the right, it was part of the mountain i was walking on, and at the end, it was clouds, floating over the mountian, something like a snail crawling over a curve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i was looking this from 100m, and soon i reached there too, and mannn the wind speed was soo soo high, i coulnd dare to stand on the edge. but we cant see the horizon was covered with cloud and mist was merged into dark forest woods. as we move our vision further you can see the freen mountain ruing into dark mountain and slowy getting merged with mist, like a things getting dissapeard into the mist. that valley seems like a slide to me, a 5000 feet slide covered with dense forest, and spreading till the the edge pf the horizon. we cant see the floor of the vally, completely coverd wit trees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so it was a point where two mountains meet, and a pass/valley is created. the wind hitting the two mountains side by side creats a funnel effect, where the wind converges and its speed increses enoromusly. something like a ram effect in the jet engine. i stood there for a min to closed my eyes, feeling the high speed wind areting the gushing sound. some of my pther firnds reached withing a min for so. i clicked few pictures, creted timelaps of the c,ouds falling of a clif(yes exacly like a waterfall). i have never seen clouds in this speedy motion before.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can see a cliff form this spot, i thoght finally, 30 min mor of hiking to reach the might kumar parvata. guide kept telling the above is shesh parvat, but i couldnt under stadn which one, coz there were many clifs next to it. socha hoga baju wala shesha parvat hoga, and 100m baki me dikh raha wo kumar parvat hoga.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after reaching the cliff. i sat in relief, that wow, buddy you did it. the cliff was completely covered in cloud(not mist, not fog, clouds). isaw some people going even further, the route goes downwards. i thought must be some small spot nest to it for a better view or something. our guide arrived at the cliff as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while i was happily recoring timelaps, she said, comeon, let keep moving, i m like where? we are alredy on the kumar parvat. then it hit me, son of a bitch, we are on shesha parvat, and, and kumarpart is 1 more hour away. i m like, ho gaya mera.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but itna aaye hain to thoda aur sahi, “seh lenge thoda” xd.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;so we followed the path path which goes downwards, while on top, there were no trees etc, it was a hill top, when we atared moving downwards, it was a super dense forest. no defined path, and tree branches are everywhere on the path. Imagine a dense forest, where the only marker to move is no grass on the floor. if it had been not used by 2 more days, the grass would have made that path dissapear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i kept walking with vishal while also vloggin on my action camera, this was mosly the decent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after some time we took a break, for others to arrive. we sat on a very steeply inclined rocky path, wide enough that 3-4 people can pass though simultabously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after 5 min or so, ther was no cummunicatino from our other team, harash, the guide at the back wasnt responding on walie talki. we we aited a bit more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when everyone reached we got a group picture there. now only 10-15 min of hike was left for kumar parvata.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we arrived at a poitn where it was a 60-70 degree climb. we were climbing on rocks made from volcanic eruption happened millions of year ago, said aditya(now i got his name). you cant see much farther than 10 feet, and it is scary ass climb, and “steep” cant even define that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;then there comes a grand entry to the kumar parvata, it seems like a well defined 2 feet path, cut out from a maze made of bushes. a sight of relief.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;but there was so much fog, everyone was looking like a zonbie movie character. i swear if someone alone, and someone played the hoirror music there, he might run for his life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on the top, there was a pile of rocks, it s famous structure where everyone clicks piture in sense of achievement. we all got out pics there too. there was a temple at the top as well. only some people whet there, including me. you are supposed to remove shoes first. and dud, the mountain was so cold. it was giving relaxing massage and cold was biting my feet simultanously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we ate our breakfast, and chocolates there. it was cloudy, there, you cant nsee more that 5-10 feet there. plus windy too. overall a very good sensation. we couldnt see anything from the top, but it felt good. i didnt care about the view there, i wa happy that i reached the top. everyone hair was having dew drops in them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we all gathered, guides did our counting, and zoom zoom, we started our way back to the camping site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i told you, i know i will be in pain during decent so i had to take several stops, so started early. our way back was not that foggy. it was 9am already. some of us again struggled to move from kumar parvata to shasha parvat. through the same dense forest, but this time we could see the forest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we reached the shesha parvat, took some break. and the view after the clouds were gone was completely differnt. now the the shades of green were differnet, the dew on the leaves was making the trees sparkle. the chilly wind was adding cooling down the effect of scrotching sun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line. Collaboratively administrate turnkey channels whereas virtual e-tailers. Objectively seize scalable metrics whereas proactive e-services. Seamlessly empower fully researched growth strategies and interoperable internal or “organic” sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.&lt;/p&gt;
