                <description>&lt;p&gt;Exploring Hampi: A Journey of Adventure, Laughter, and Unexpected Surprises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since my last trip outside Bangalore, and with a long weekend approaching, the urge to escape was strong. My friend Mohit and I decided to take a short trip, and after checking with our other college friends (who unfortunately were busy), it was just the three of us—Mohit, his girlfriend Juhi, and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Journey Begins: A Chaotic Start&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the most of our time, we booked an overnight bus from Bangalore to Hampi. The plan was simple: meet up for dinner at HSR Layout, board the bus by 9:00 PM, and wake up in Hospet, the nearest city to Hampi, by 4:00 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was going smoothly until Mohit called me in a panic while I was on my way to deliver a Zoomcar vehicle. We had miscalculated the departure time—the bus was leaving at 9:00 PM, not 10:00 PM! Mohit and Juhi managed to board the bus at Madiwala, but I had to think fast. With just 45 minutes before the bus would reach Anand Rao Circle, I knew a cab wouldn’t cut it in Bangalore’s traffic. I quickly booked a Rapido bike, and thanks to a speedy driver who weaved through the traffic like a pro, I reached the pickup point just in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adventure had begun even before we left Bangalore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Suspicious Encounter at the Bus Station&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing there wouldn’t be any dinner breaks, I decided to use a pay-and-use washroom at the station. As I handed over ₹10 to the attendant, something felt off. Typically, such facilities charge ₹3-₹5. I checked the board outside, but the pricing details were suspiciously covered with paint or stickers. As I kept looking, the attendant got nervous and suddenly called me back, returning ₹5. While I didn’t argue further, it was clear he had been overcharging people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this little victory, I boarded the bus, settled into my seat, and got comfortable for the journey ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching Hospet: The Auto Fare Hustle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus ride was smooth, and by 4:00 AM, we arrived in Hospet, where we were immediately swarmed by auto drivers. Their initial quotes were ridiculous—₹1000 for a short trip to Hampi, or ₹3500 for a full-day tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried negotiating with a nearby group of four travelers, but they weren’t interested in sharing. One girl rudely dismissed us, saying they had a pre-booked cab. Not letting this dampen our spirits, we finally bargained an auto for ₹500 and reached Hampi in 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matunga Hill: A Breathtaking Sunrise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was a small tea stall, where we warmed up with chai in the chilly morning air. The auto driver suggested visiting Malyavanta Hill for sunrise, but after checking Google reviews, we chose Matunga Hill instead—it was closer and had better views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the base, we met three other travelers, and together, we started our 20-minute hike in total darkness. It was surreal, trying to spot Hampi’s temples just by their silhouettes. Once at the top, we removed our shoes at a small temple and settled in, waiting for the sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful moment didn’t last long. A chai vendor warned us about the monkeys that would soon arrive looking for food. Right on cue, a troop of them appeared, scanning for unattended bags. One sneaky monkey sat next to my bag, unzipped it, and pulled out my UNO cards! What followed was a chaotic battle of wits, with the monkey determined to escape with its newfound treasure. It even pulled out my toothbrush and shampoo before I managed to snatch the bag back—but not before it ran off with my UNO deck. Everyone burst into laughter at the absurdity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun finally rose, casting golden light over the ancient ruins, we clicked some stunning pictures and soaked in the beauty of Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hampi Bazaar and Stone Chariot Temple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descending the hill, we got our first proper look at Hampi in daylight. The ancient Hampi Bazaar stretched for half a kilometer, with stone pillars forming what was once a bustling marketplace. Centuries ago, merchants traded everything from diamonds to groceries here—it was fascinating to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hired an auto for ₹2000 to explore Hampi’s key sites. Our first stop was Vijaya Vittala Temple, home to the famous stone chariot featured on the ₹50 note. On the way, I convinced the auto driver to let me drive, and for 5 km, I took control of the rickshaw, navigating the bumpy roads with glee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the temple, we met a Polish traveler who was an avid biker. We bonded over our love for road trips, but since he was heading to Mysore next, our plans didn’t align. After taking the mandatory picture with the stone chariot, we moved on to explore more of Hampi’s royal heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Dal Disaster and Sunset Serenity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By midday, exhaustion kicked in, and we stopped at Happy Hampi Café. The restaurant had a unique setup—mattresses on the floor instead of chairs. We lay down, finally getting some rest, when suddenly, chaos struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohit accidentally knocked over a dal container, drenching himself and Juhi in yellow dal. The sight of them, completely covered in dal, had us all in stitches. It took a moment to process what had happened before we burst into uncontrollable laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a good meal and some much-needed downtime, we continued exploring more temples before heading to Tungabhadra Lake for a coracle boat ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, we hesitated due to the ₹500 per person charge, but eventually, we went for it. As we paddled across the calm waters, the setting sun cast a golden glow over the landscape. I even got a chance to row the boat, only to realize how physically exhausting it was! Watching the sunset from the middle of the lake, with our hands dipped in the cool water, was the perfect way to end our day in Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Photos of boat ride&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapping Up: Shopping and the Journey Back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at the Hampi market to buy some fridge magnets as souvenirs before heading back to Hospet. Since our bus was at 9:00 PM, we had plenty of time for a leisurely dinner. We tried a nearby ice cream parlor with an overwhelming number of flavor combinations before finally boarding our bus back to Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 4:00 AM, we were back in the city, exhausted but happy. Mohit booked a cab, and just like that, our whirlwind trip to Hampi came to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From unexpected bus chases to monkey heists and dal disasters, this trip had everything—adventure, history, and laughter. Hampi, with its ancient ruins and surreal landscapes, had given us memories to cherish forever. Until the next adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Shri Adinatha Digambara Jaina Basadi (Anivalu)</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I m part of a gyanoday bachelors group on whatsapp, it good community in bangalore for all sorts of purposes. the community have several use case such as finding jain flatmates, mostly aroung the gyanoday temple itself, airport ride sharing, wanterers(traveller) group, some mandir volunteering activities, etc. for all young folks to stay connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;most of the people live right next to the gyanoday temple itself.
since it alway full of msgs i usually check the group once a week with 200-300 msgs, just glimps through them from the surface.
An image caught my attension, it was of a temple, but entire poster was in kannda, so i couldnt understand. Below the image was a caption, final reminder, and that message wali linked to an older msg on the same group. i navigated to the older msg and found the complete descripiton.
it was about restoring an old jain temple, which is kinda lost in the bushes due to no maintanance and lack of jain coominity in that town, it was arounf 300km from bangalore. they had arranged the transport from blr to Anivalu. They found some sponsor for breakfast and lunch but the travel cost must be beared by the entire group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it sounded interesting to me, its for a great cause and anyways i havent had any plans for the weekend. I curiously msged the admin about more details about this.
he replied instantly, with above description. upon asking timeline, he mentined that we will leave from karnataka jain associan at 6am in the morning.
reach anivalu temple in arounf 4 hour. cleaning might take another 3 hour. then we will visit the temples nearby as well. and we will be back by sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it sounded good, i requested them to take me in as well if they have any seats available. my place was locked. i confirmed if they have any bike parking there, since it will be time consuming to get auto 4:30in the morning.
the trip was starting next day itself. this day, i slept early coz i have to wake up early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the next day
i woke up at 4:30, since the karnataka jain associan was about 15ish km from my place. i quickly bath and left at arounf 5am from my  place.
it was still dark outside, and i have never been to this part of bangalore earlier. but the feeling was nice, good ealy morning cool breeze, and i was humming some songs cluzing slowly on the roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i reached karnatak jain associan, on the entrance itself i see about 20folks, almost all of them are under 25 standing circles. i parked my bike in the basement and came to join the group. i had a pre-assumption in mind that most will be from the bundelkhad, coz the entire gyanday is full of jain from bundelkhad region.
but to my surprise no one from bundelkhad, i tried to communicate a little, but language barrier barged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i went to temple for darshan, in the back of my mind i was thinking kaha fas gaya. i was hoping this will a fun activity where i will meet some new folks. but here, either they were already friend circles, and if not, almost all of them were talking in kannda which i have absolutey no idea about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our bus was yet to arrive, and we were waiting for several other people to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;initially the plan was to take breakfast with us and eat on the way. but due to delay and wiaing for several other folks, they changd the plan to leave after havking the breakfast. everyone went inside the dharmshala next to temple to wash hands and came back outside where the breakfst was getting ditributed. some idli and besebellebhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i joined the queue and started having breakfast. i saw another guy having breakfast and not interacting with any other folks, i soon realised that he must also be non-kannada thats why. he was looking arounf 5-8 years older to me. while having breakfst, it was getting crowded near the queue, so both of us went to little side to that our food wont get spilled. we started having some small conversations as well. he was from north india and had mostly spent his time outside india and studied in uc berkly university. he worked outside india for some yers then came back to india.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it felt good that even after studying and working in US people are down to earth and ready to make efforts for their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after finishing our breakfast and chai everyone sat in the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was small bus with a capacity fo 50. but only 35-40 seats were occupied.
it was around 7:30am just start our journey. i was damn sure we wont make it back by sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;weather was still cozy and leaned towards the wind to take a nap, but he city roads were bumpy, which were constantly making me hit the window.
so i watined for a while till the city roads are over so i can take some rest, i knew the day is gonna get long. i took a nap for about 1-2 hour then bus took a break. those who missed the breakfast started having breakfast. since i already had breakfast i chose not to eat again.
i was stand next to the but itself, and there was a group of yound boys in their early 20s having fun messing around with each other. one of them asked if i was with someone, i said, “no, i came by my self”. how the time passed and we started having conversation. so they are regular members of gyanoday abhishek group who go to temple for abhishek daily. onle 4 of them came for this trip. 2 of them are from karnatak itself, and 2 are from north. akkole ji are from sadlaga itself our  guru acharya shri ji’s hometown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;while other were having rbeakfast we went to have some tea to a shop across the road.
i see several biker groups passing by us on the mangalore highway. it reminded me of my bike trips on this road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a good time chatting while sipping tea, and i was feeling good that i am finally making some friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after the break we started again, and i was sitting with these guys. I got to know another guy who was sitting next to me, his name is also paras jain. he works in Netradyne and he studied from iit bhu and they go to shikharji every year sponsorred by jain juniors from the college, arounf 150 folks go every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We statred having some conversation about work, something related to code and database optimsation.
time passed and we reached the temple around 12:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we were greeted by the local jain community, and they were very happy to see us.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Nandi Hills</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Adventure to Nandi Hills: A Journey of Surprises and Laughter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since Keshav visited Bangalore, and he was about to head back to his hometown. Having recently joined Samsung SDS, where most of the work is remote, staying in Bangalore no longer made sense for him. So, to make the most of his time in the city, we decided to plan a trip. The destination? Nandi Hills. None of us had been there before, and it was about time we checked out this famous spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was simple: leave early, catch the sunrise, and enjoy a peaceful morning at the hilltop. Our group consisted of Keshav, his brother, Mohit, and myself. The excitement was palpable, even though we had heard mixed reviews about Nandi Hills. People often said it was overrated, with no spectacular views or much to see. But we were determined to make our own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to take my car for the trip and aimed to leave by 4 AM so that we could reach Nandi Hills by around 5:30 AM. I woke up at 4 AM, full of excitement, even though I had lived in Bangalore for over two years and had never visited Nandi Hills myself. The morning was cool, and the anticipation of the sunrise made the early start worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge? Waking up everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keshav and his brother were already up, but Mohit, as usual, was still fast asleep. We tried calling him multiple times, but his phone was on Do Not Disturb mode—something he had forgotten to disable. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to rouse him, we decided to leave without him. It wasn’t the ideal start, but we figured we’d meet him later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 4:15 AM, we were on the road, with the city still shrouded in darkness. As expected, Bangalore’s notorious traffic was already in full swing. At 4 AM, seriously? I thought we were in the clear, but the Hebbal Flyover had a surprise in store for us. It was slow-moving, and we couldn’t understand why there was so much congestion at that hour. Eventually, we passed the traffic and headed towards Nandi Hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool breeze was refreshing as we kept the windows down and cruised through the early morning roads. We started reminiscing about old memories, laughing at inside jokes, and getting to know Keshav’s brother better. It felt like one of those perfect road trips that was more about the journey than the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a wrong turn, thinking we were still on the right path. Instead of heading straight to Nandi Hills, we veered off to the right, which led us on a loop around the entire hill. This detour added another 30 minutes to our drive, but eventually, we reached the entrance to Nandi Hills. The sight that greeted us was a little overwhelming: a long line of cars waiting to climb the hill. There were about 200 cars in line, all trying to ascend the winding roads of the hill. And to make matters more interesting, two-wheelers were bypassing us from the right, squeezing through the narrow gaps to avoid the wait. It was a single-lane road, so only one car could go up at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunger set in, and while we were stuck in the long line, Keshav decided to take matters into his own hands. He got out of the slow-moving car and grabbed us some tea and snacks. There we were, sipping tea in the car while waiting in a traffic jam at 5 AM. We joked that we should’ve brought bikes instead of the car—at least we would’ve saved time. The weather, though, was perfect—cold and refreshing. But just as we were getting comfortable, the rain started. We quickly took back our words; the car was definitely the better choice after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after another 30 minutes of slow progress, we made it to the top of Nandi Hills. The weather had become even more unpredictable, and the fog was so thick that we could barely see a few meters ahead. The road to the top was steep, and the hairpin bends made it feel like a true hill station drive. But with the fog and rain, we couldn’t see much of the beautiful views that we had hoped for. We honked at every corner, just in case another car was coming from the other side, as the road was so narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached the top, we parked the car and stepped out into the misty morning. The security guards and police officers were busy directing cars into parking spots, and the whole place had an eerie, quiet vibe. The fog was so dense that we couldn’t see the sunrise at all—just trees and more fog. The anticipation quickly turned to disappointment, but we made the best of it by laughing at the situation. We ate the snacks Keshav had brought and continued talking about random things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for us to realize that the whole experience was indeed overrated. No sunrise, no sweeping views—just fog, trees, and cold weather. But we weren’t ready to let the trip be a total bust. We decided to take some photos and head back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, our stomachs were growling. We spotted a few roadside eateries that looked promising, and decided to stop at Adyar Ananda Bhavan (A2B) near Rani Circle. The breakfast was delicious, and it felt good to relax after the adventure. While we were enjoying our food, we struck up a conversation with a group of four men sitting at the table next to ours. They were in their 40s or 50s and seemed to be on a road trip as a reunion. They had started their journey from Nagpur and were on their way to Kanyakumari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious about our travels, they asked for some road trip recommendations. It felt nice to share what we knew and swap travel stories with fellow explorers. It was a reminder that no matter where we go, the journey is as much about the people you meet along the way as it is about the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, Keshav took the wheel for the drive back to Bangalore. The mood was light, and we continued to talk about future trips and other places we wanted to explore. The return journey was as fun as the drive to Nandi Hills, and by the time we got back, we were all in good spirits, even if the trip didn’t exactly go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, our trip to Nandi Hills might not have been what we expected, but it was a memorable adventure filled with laughs, a little bit of chaos, and plenty of good stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
