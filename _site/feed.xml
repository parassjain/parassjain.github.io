                <title>Kudrekukh Trek</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I planned this trek with the BMC Adventure Club, having previously done the Kumaraparvatha trek with them. Our journey began with an overnight bus ride from Bangalore to Kudremukh, reaching the base camp at 6 AM. A warm breakfast of chai and idli set the tone for the adventure ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 6:30 AM, we started the trek. Monsoon season made the trail extremely slippery and infested with leeches. Since I wasn’t prepared for leeches, I felt a bit nervous. Another trekking group was headed to Vali Kunja Trek, which is even more notorious for leeches. They were well-prepared with leech socks and leech guards, making me second-guess my own preparedness. Despite the initial hesitation, I decided to push forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A jeep dropped us off at the starting point, and from there, it was a 7 km trek that took us around 4 hours to reach the top. The trail meandered through dense forests, and soon, it started to drizzle, making the terrain even trickier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started chatting with my fellow trekkers—some from Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi—and we bonded over shared trekking experiences. Our first break was for instructions, and while standing still, I realized a leech had latched onto my shoe. My left foot was bleeding, but I couldn’t even find the leech! The anticoagulant it released meant the bleeding wouldn’t stop quickly. Tightening my shoelaces, I pressed on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher we climbed, the better the views became. Lush green grasslands, misty valleys, and the occasional sunlight filtering through made for some breathtaking sights. We took a break at benches along the way, where I shared my dry fruits and snacks with the team. These quick energy boosters were much needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/q1/IMG_20240629_105509.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mid 2km were mosly flat and easy. The last 2 km were the most challenging, with a steep incline that tested our endurance. As the rain stopped, we found ourselves walking in a dense mist, with rolling hills and valleys below, eerily resembling the Windows XP wallpaper. Once we conquered the steep ascent, it was a flat walk leading to the summit, where the landscape transformed into a mix of grasslands on one side and dense forest on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top, it was incredibly windy, and the clouds passed right through us. With limited visibility, we could barely see 5 feet ahead, but the thrill of being at the peak was exhilarating. We settled down to enjoy our packed lunches, a meal that tasted even better after the grueling climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent began post-lunch, but my wet socks made me feel cold. Luckily, my past trekking experiences had taught me to pack extra socks, so I changed into a dry pair. Initially, the descent was sunny, offering spectacular valley views, but soon, it started raining again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail quickly turned into a water slide, requiring extreme caution. Each step had to be calculated to avoid slipping. A local guide showed us how to maneuver through the challenging terrain. After two hours of descending, the trail became repetitive, and exhaustion set in—it felt like a never-ending flight with the same view of clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up my pace and reached the base camp by 6 PM, where a hot cup of chai and snacks awaited us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kudremukh Trek was an incredible experience, balancing challenges and scenic rewards. It’s not the toughest trek, but the slippery trails and leeches make it unique. If you plan to do this trek, I highly recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wearing leech socks and carrying salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Packing extra socks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carrying dry fruits or energy bars for quick refueling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preparing for rain and slippery conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day, we stayed at a homestay nestled in the mountains, where the views were breathtaking, even though the food was just okay. We had a hearty dinner and called it a night, wrapping up an adventure to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, before heading back to Bangalore, we went to Belur, home to the famous Chennakesava Temple, an architectural masterpiece from the Hoysala era. The temple’s intricate carvings and grandeur left us mesmerized. Walking through the beautifully sculpted halls, we admired the detailed stonework depicting mythological stories. Spending some time soaking in the history and artistry of the temple provided a peaceful end to our adventurous weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Krishnagiri Dam</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best trips are the ones you don’t plan. That’s exactly how our bike ride to Krishnagiri Dam happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a Saturday morning in June, and the weather was perfect for a ride—cool breeze, empty roads, and the promise of adventure. I started early, made a quick stop at the petrol pump to fuel up, and then headed to my friends’ place to pick them up. Since Jaideep and Himanshu live in the same flat, the meetup was quick, and by 8 AM, we were rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop? A2B restaurant for a hearty breakfast. Fresh idlis, crispy vadas, and a steaming cup of filter coffee later, we were back on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, Jaideep and I decided to switch bikes. I hopped on his BMW G310R, while he took my BMW 310RR. The difference was striking. The G310R had an upright seating position, making it super comfortable—almost like floating on a cloud. I was effortlessly cruising at 90-100 kmph. In contrast, my 310RR feels aggressive, planted, and lets you feel every bit of the road. It was fun experiencing both styles, but after 10-20 km, we switched back to our own bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 11:30 AM, we arrived at Krishnagiri Dam. To be honest, the dam itself was just okay—nothing extraordinary. A few locals were bathing in the reservoir, and the place had a laid-back vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what caught me off guard was the massive garden next to the dam. I wasn’t expecting much, but it turned out to be huge, with a deer park, children’s play area, and several families enjoying picnics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a big rock under a tree, parked ourselves there, stretched our legs, and took some photos. My friends, tired from the ride, decided to just sit and relax. But I was curious—I wanted to get a better view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving my friends behind, I crossed the garden and made my way to the dam wall. To get there, I had to climb a long flight of stairs. It took me a minute or so to reach the top, but the view was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire dam wall was painted blue and white, creating a stunning contrast against the emerald-blue water shimmering in the midday sun. The reflection made the reservoir look surreal. It was blazing hot, and I could barely keep my eyes open under the bright sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A kind gentleman noticed me struggling with selfies and offered to click some pictures. And that’s how I got my perfect shot, standing on the dam wall, soaking in the view of Krishnagiri Dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending some time enjoying the view, I climbed back down, rejoined my friends, and we geared up for the ride back. The return journey was just as fun, with the open roads and cool wind making the ride even more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spontaneous plan, great company, and a ride through beautiful roads—what more could a biker ask for?&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best way to spend a weekend is by reconnecting with nature and challenging oneself. That’s exactly what we decided to do – embark on a trek to Asia’s largest monolith hill, a perfect weekend escape from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our trekking team consisted of Sudhanshu, Ujjwal, Umakant, Anmol, Prakhar, and me. The initial plan was to start our journey at 6 AM, but as it often happens, we got a bit delayed and finally hit the road by 7 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Journey Begins
We took five bikes to reach the base of the hill. Since the area is a reserved forest, we had to book our tickets online through the Karnataka Eco Tourism website. The cost was 300 INR per person, which we found reasonable considering the experience that awaited us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching the base, we parked our bikes and found a small snack shop nearby. The shop owner kindly offered to keep our helmets, heavy jackets, and bags for free, which was a great relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief stop at the snack shop, we moved to the starting point of the trek, where a security guard checked our tickets. Soon, a guide joined us to lead the way. The trek began easily enough, but it didn’t take long for the trail to become steeper and more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took several breaks along the way, capturing the scenic beauty with our cameras. The importance of staying hydrated during a trek cannot be overstated, and we were well-prepared with several water bottles. Anmol, in particular, was our savior with his duffel bag full of snacks and extra water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat intensified, making the trek more taxing. Despite the increasing temperature, the beautiful landscape kept us motivated. The view from the top was absolutely breathtaking, making every bit of effort worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trekking Asia’s largest monolith hill was an unforgettable experience. It was a perfect mix of adventure, camaraderie, and natural beauty. If you’re looking for a weekend getaway from Bangalore that offers both a physical challenge and stunning vistas, this trek is definitely worth considering.

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the best way to spend a weekend is by reconnecting with nature and challenging oneself. That’s exactly what we decided to do – embark on a trek to Asia’s largest monolith hill, a perfect weekend escape from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our trekking team consisted of Sudhanshu, Ujjwal, Umakant, Anmol, Prakhar, and me. The initial plan was to start our journey at 6 AM, but as it often happens, we got a bit delayed and finally hit the road by 7 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Journey Begins
We took five bikes to reach the base of the hill. Since the area is a reserved forest, we had to book our tickets online through the Karnataka Eco Tourism website. The cost was 300 INR per person, which we found reasonable considering the experience that awaited us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching the base, we parked our bikes and found a small snack shop nearby. The shop owner kindly offered to keep our helmets, heavy jackets, and bags for free, which was a great relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/q1/IMG_0363.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/q1/IMG20240420065300.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/q1/IMG_1063.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Photos of savandurga hill&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief stop at the snack shop, we moved to the starting point of the trek, where a security guard checked our tickets. Soon, a guide joined us to lead the way. The trek began easily enough, but it didn’t take long for the trail to become steeper and more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took several breaks along the way, capturing the scenic beauty with our cameras. The importance of staying hydrated during a trek cannot be overstated, and we were well-prepared with several water bottles. Anmol, in particular, was our savior with his duffel bag full of snacks and extra water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat intensified, making the trek more taxing. Despite the increasing temperature, the beautiful landscape kept us motivated. The view from the top was absolutely breathtaking, making every bit of effort worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trekking Asia’s largest monolith hill was an unforgettable experience. It was a perfect mix of adventure, camaraderie, and natural beauty. If you’re looking for a weekend getaway from Bangalore that offers both a physical challenge and stunning vistas, this trek is definitely worth considering. Just remember to book your tickets in advance, pack plenty of water, and bring along good friends to share the journey with.&lt;/p&gt;
