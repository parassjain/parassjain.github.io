                <title>Savandurga Trek</title>
                <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we had to do something on the weekend, so we decided to go for a trek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sudhanshu, ujjwal, umakant, anmol, prakhar joined me on the trek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a perfect weekend getaway from Bangalore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asia’s largest monolith hill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we took 5 bikes to reach the base of the hill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;since this is reserved forest area so we need to book tickets online on karnataka eco tourism website, it costs 300 per person&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we planned to start by 6 but everone got late and we started by 7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we reached the base wher we parked our bikes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/q1/IMG_0363.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;House&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Photos of savandurga hill&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;next to the parking there was a small snacks shop which offered us to keep our helmets, heavy jackes and bags for free&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we reached the starting point where a security guard checked our tickets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;soon a guide joined us to start the trek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;at the start of the trek it seemed really easy, but as we moved formwad the trail became steeper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we keep on taking brakes and clicked some photos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we had several water bottle with us so thankfull we were hydrated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anmol brought several snacks which we needed badly during the hike.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;he had a duffel bag with him which had all the snacks and water bottles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as the time passed the sun started to shine brightly and it became really hot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the landscape was looking very beautiful from the top&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;on our&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Bird Sanctuary - Abondanded Railway Yard</title>
                <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We had a some free time of couple of hours in kochi, so we decided to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/NtZmadtDkjSbPWfU8&quot;&gt;Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The sanctuary is a green oasis in the heart of Kochi city. It is a bird sanctuary located in the central part of the city and is easily accessible from the city.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next to it was a railway yard, which was abandoned. We were curious to see what was inside the yard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;first we went inside the sanctuary, it was a small sanctuary, nothing much was there, but we saw a DO NOT ENTER sign in the center. After getting close, we realised it s a bird watch tower, makde out of wood, really high. Since we were curious and disobedient, we decided to climb it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it must be of a height of 4-5 floors, umkant stood at the base of entrance to watch any guard coming, while ujjwal and I climbed the tower.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as soon as we climed 1 floor, we realied why it was a DO NOT ENTER zone, the tower was shaking, and we were scared to death. We climbed 3 more floors and reached the top. The view from the top was amazing, we could see the whole sanctuary, its like living in a tree house. completely covered with lush green trees. just like view in waynad, but upclose.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there was a cctv camera also present on the top. once we stopped climbuing the tower stopped wobbling and we were able to take some good pics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while coming down the wooden stares, manager of bird sanctuary came and asked for our tickets. we showed him the tickets. then he asked our id cards, i thought that we are doomed. then he spoke outloud looking at our id cards, “UP, Delhi, MP”. you 3 states are the most mischief makers in the country. we were scared to death, but we laughed a little. we felt sorry(not really) and then he lt us go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we roamed around the sanctuary for some time, clicked some pics and went outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/2022-06-15.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;House&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/IMG_20240128_122447.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;House&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Photos of watch tower, and bird santury&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;just at the exit of the bird sanctuary, there was a railway yard, which was abandoned. and ther was a big sign PROTECTED AREA. us being us, we were curious to see what was inside. we went inside the yard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it was full of bushes and trees. it was active during the british era, but now it was abandoned. we saw some old tracks, were there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;after crossing the buses, we saw a old age beautiful building made completly out of stone. it was the structure of railway station. trees were growing out of the building. it was a beautiful sight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;looking upclose to some wall, it was full of maths equations, we thought it was some students who had written it. but then we realised it was some old railway workers who had written it. maybe some caluclations for the railway or someone might be taking maths classes there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;next to it were 3 raily lines. they they were not in use since 50-60 year, trees had grown on the tracks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we cliked a lot of pics, had a look arounf in the grass, and then we left the place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;while jumping the fence to exit the yard, we saw the same uncle sitting on the side of exiti with his friends. he saw us and said something to his friend in malayalam, and they laughed. we laughed too. we undestood they were talking about me. and he repeaded again “UP, Delhi, MP” while pointing us in funny way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we had a quick chat with him and then left the place. we were happy that we were not caught by the guard. we had a good time in the sanctuary and the railway yard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>Munnar</title>
                <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;150km road trip from kochi to munnar on 2 scooters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The journey was filled with scenic views, tea plantations, and a buttery smooth ride.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The weather was perfect, and the roads were almost empty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We stopped at a few places to take pictures and enjoy the view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;munnar tea plantation was a treat to the eyes, they looked like a green carpet, exactly like the ones we see in movies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We reached munnar by 2 pm and had some local food.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we started our journey back to kochi by 4 pm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
