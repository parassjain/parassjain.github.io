                <description>&lt;p&gt;Exploring Hampi: A Journey of Adventure, Laughter, and Unexpected Surprises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since my last trip outside Bangalore, and with a long weekend approaching, the urge to escape was strong. My friend Mohit and I decided to take a short trip, and after checking with our other college friends (who unfortunately were busy), it was just the three of us—Mohit, his girlfriend Juhi, and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Journey Begins: A Chaotic Start&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the most of our time, we booked an overnight bus from Bangalore to Hampi. The plan was simple: meet up for dinner at HSR Layout, board the bus by 9:00 PM, and wake up in Hospet, the nearest city to Hampi, by 4:00 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was going smoothly until Mohit called me in a panic while I was on my way to deliver a Zoomcar vehicle. We had miscalculated the departure time—the bus was leaving at 9:00 PM, not 10:00 PM! Mohit and Juhi managed to board the bus at Madiwala, but I had to think fast. With just 45 minutes before the bus would reach Anand Rao Circle, I knew a cab wouldn’t cut it in Bangalore’s traffic. I quickly booked a Rapido bike, and thanks to a speedy driver who weaved through the traffic like a pro, I reached the pickup point just in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adventure had begun even before we left Bangalore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Suspicious Encounter at the Bus Station&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing there wouldn’t be any dinner breaks, I decided to use a pay-and-use washroom at the station. As I handed over ₹10 to the attendant, something felt off. Typically, such facilities charge ₹3-₹5. I checked the board outside, but the pricing details were suspiciously covered with paint or stickers. As I kept looking, the attendant got nervous and suddenly called me back, returning ₹5. While I didn’t argue further, it was clear he had been overcharging people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this little victory, I boarded the bus, settled into my seat, and got comfortable for the journey ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching Hospet: The Auto Fare Hustle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus ride was smooth, and by 4:00 AM, we arrived in Hospet, where we were immediately swarmed by auto drivers. Their initial quotes were ridiculous—₹1000 for a short trip to Hampi, or ₹3500 for a full-day tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried negotiating with a nearby group of four travelers, but they weren’t interested in sharing. One girl rudely dismissed us, saying they had a pre-booked cab. Not letting this dampen our spirits, we finally bargained an auto for ₹500 and reached Hampi in 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matunga Hill: A Breathtaking Sunrise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was a small tea stall, where we warmed up with chai in the chilly morning air. The auto driver suggested visiting Malyavanta Hill for sunrise, but after checking Google reviews, we chose Matunga Hill instead—it was closer and had better views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the base, we met three other travelers, and together, we started our 20-minute hike in total darkness. It was surreal, trying to spot Hampi’s temples just by their silhouettes. Once at the top, we removed our shoes at a small temple and settled in, waiting for the sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaceful moment didn’t last long. A chai vendor warned us about the monkeys that would soon arrive looking for food. Right on cue, a troop of them appeared, scanning for unattended bags. One sneaky monkey sat next to my bag, unzipped it, and pulled out my UNO cards! What followed was a chaotic battle of wits, with the monkey determined to escape with its newfound treasure. It even pulled out my toothbrush and shampoo before I managed to snatch the bag back—but not before it ran off with my UNO deck. Everyone burst into laughter at the absurdity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun finally rose, casting golden light over the ancient ruins, we clicked some stunning pictures and soaked in the beauty of Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hampi Bazaar and Stone Chariot Temple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descending the hill, we got our first proper look at Hampi in daylight. The ancient Hampi Bazaar stretched for half a kilometer, with stone pillars forming what was once a bustling marketplace. Centuries ago, merchants traded everything from diamonds to groceries here—it was fascinating to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hired an auto for ₹2000 to explore Hampi’s key sites. Our first stop was Vijaya Vittala Temple, home to the famous stone chariot featured on the ₹50 note. On the way, I convinced the auto driver to let me drive, and for 5 km, I took control of the rickshaw, navigating the bumpy roads with glee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the temple, we met a Polish traveler who was an avid biker. We bonded over our love for road trips, but since he was heading to Mysore next, our plans didn’t align. After taking the mandatory picture with the stone chariot, we moved on to explore more of Hampi’s royal heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Dal Disaster and Sunset Serenity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By midday, exhaustion kicked in, and we stopped at Happy Hampi Café. The restaurant had a unique setup—mattresses on the floor instead of chairs. We lay down, finally getting some rest, when suddenly, chaos struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohit accidentally knocked over a dal container, drenching himself and Juhi in yellow dal. The sight of them, completely covered in dal, had us all in stitches. It took a moment to process what had happened before we burst into uncontrollable laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a good meal and some much-needed downtime, we continued exploring more temples before heading to Tungabhadra Lake for a coracle boat ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, we hesitated due to the ₹500 per person charge, but eventually, we went for it. As we paddled across the calm waters, the setting sun cast a golden glow over the landscape. I even got a chance to row the boat, only to realize how physically exhausting it was! Watching the sunset from the middle of the lake, with our hands dipped in the cool water, was the perfect way to end our day in Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Photos of boat ride&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapping Up: Shopping and the Journey Back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at the Hampi market to buy some fridge magnets as souvenirs before heading back to Hospet. Since our bus was at 9:00 PM, we had plenty of time for a leisurely dinner. We tried a nearby ice cream parlor with an overwhelming number of flavor combinations before finally boarding our bus back to Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 4:00 AM, we were back in the city, exhausted but happy. Mohit booked a cab, and just like that, our whirlwind trip to Hampi came to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From unexpected bus chases to monkey heists and dal disasters, this trip had everything—adventure, history, and laughter. Hampi, with its ancient ruins and surreal landscapes, had given us memories to cherish forever. Until the next adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Shri Adinatha Digambara Jaina Basadi (Anivalu)</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A Day of Volunteering: Restoring a Forgotten Jain Temple
I’m part of a Gyanoday Bachelors group on WhatsApp. It’s a great community in Bangalore that serves multiple purposes—finding Jain flatmates (mostly around the Gyanoday temple), sharing airport rides, organizing travel through the “Wanderers” subgroup, volunteering at temples, and generally helping young people stay connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the group members live around the Gyanoday temple. Since the group is always buzzing with messages, I usually check in once a week, skimming through the 200–300 unread messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, an image caught my attention—it was a photo of a temple, but the entire poster was in Kannada, so I couldn’t understand it. Below the image was a caption that read, “Final reminder.” It linked to an older message in the group. I followed the link and found a detailed post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about restoring an old Jain temple, which had become overgrown and forgotten due to lack of maintenance and absence of a Jain community in that town. The temple was in Anivalu, about 300 km from Bangalore. The organizers had arranged transport from Bangalore, and food was sponsored—but each participant would need to cover their own travel cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounded like a great cause. I didn’t have any plans for the weekend anyway, so I messaged the admin for more details. He replied promptly and shared the full itinerary. The plan was to leave from Karnataka Jain Association at 6 AM, reach Anivalu in about four hours, clean the temple for three hours, visit a few nearby temples, and return to Bangalore by sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked if there was a seat available and confirmed my spot. I also checked if there was bike parking at the starting point since getting an auto at 4:30 AM would be difficult. Once all was sorted, I slept early to prepare for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Next Morning
I woke up at 4:30 AM. Karnataka Jain Association was about 15 km from my place, so I quickly got ready and left around 5 AM. It was still dark outside, and I had never been to this part of Bangalore before. But it felt nice—cool early morning breeze, empty roads, and I was humming some tunes while cruising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I reached, I saw around 20 people gathered at the entrance—mostly under 25, standing in small circles. I parked my bike and joined them. I had assumed that most people would be from Bundelkhand since the Gyanoday community has a strong presence from that region. But to my surprise, no one was from Bundelkhand. I tried to strike up a few conversations, but the language barrier kicked in—most were speaking Kannada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went inside the temple for darshan, but at the back of my mind, I was wondering if I’d made a mistake. I was hoping to meet some new people and have a fun experience, but everyone seemed to already know each other, and the language difference felt like a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were still waiting for the bus and for a few more people to join. The initial plan was to carry breakfast and eat en route, but due to delays, the plan changed—we would eat breakfast first and then leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone washed up in the dharamshala next to the temple and lined up for breakfast—idli and bisibelebath. While eating, I noticed a guy who also wasn’t mingling with the others. He seemed older—maybe 5 to 8 years senior to me. I figured he was probably not from Karnataka either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up having breakfast together and started chatting. He was from North India and had spent most of his life abroad. He studied at UC Berkeley and worked outside India for several years before returning. It was refreshing to see someone so humble and community-minded despite his international background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Road
After breakfast and tea, we boarded the bus. It was a 50-seater, but only about 35–40 seats were occupied. We left around 7:30 AM. Honestly, I was sure we wouldn’t be back by sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city roads were bumpy, so I waited for us to hit the highway before trying to nap. I dozed off for 1–2 hours until we took a break. Some folks who missed breakfast ate, while others stretched their legs. I stayed near the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearby, a group of guys in their early 20s were joking around. One of them asked if I was with someone, and I replied, “Nope, I came alone.” We started talking. Turned out they were regulars from the Gyanoday Abhishek group and visited the temple daily. Two were from Karnataka, two from the North. One guy, Akkole ji, was from Sadalga, the hometown of our guru Acharya Shri Ji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While others finished eating, we crossed the road for tea. Watching biker groups zoom past on the Mangalore highway reminded me of my own bike trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the bus, I sat with these new friends. One of them, also named Paras Jain, worked at Netradyne and had studied at IIT BHU. Every year, they organize a sponsored Shikharji trip for around 150 Jain juniors from his college. We even chatted a bit about work—coding, database optimization, and the usual tech stuff. Time flew, and we reached Anivalu around 12:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Restoration Begins
The local Jain community welcomed us warmly. We washed our hands and climbed about 30 steps to the temple. At first glance, it was clear the temple hadn’t been maintained in years—bushes everywhere, layers of dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Photos of Temple during cleaning&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the temple got its electricity connection that very day. After the meter was inaugurated, we did darshan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We unloaded our cleaning tools—axes, sickles, shears, brooms, shovels, rakes, wheelbarrows, buckets, trash bags, pickaxes, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People split into teams—some started cleaning the inside, and I joined the group working outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though untrained, we went all in—cutting grass, clearing thorns, removing trash. I was sweating like crazy, but it felt good doing something for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some removed huge thorny bushes; others cleared years of dust from the ground. A few climbed up to clean the temple roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an hour or so, we could finally see the stone floor around the temple—about 2 meters wide for parikrama. It was satisfying to uncover it after all the cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paused for snacks—buttermilk, water, and some namkeen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside, a small group was scrubbing floors and walls with soap and water. Later, someone arranged a petrol-powered grass cutter, which sped up the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gathered all the trash and started burning it. I sat with my new friends again and we chatted about random things. Some elderly people were sitting nearby too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One old lady came up and thanked us. Then she said something in Kannada I couldn’t understand. My friends translated—she wanted some utensils. I handed them over. When they told her I was from the North and didn’t know Kannada, her expression changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She frowned, visibly disappointed. She told us we should learn Kannada if we’re living in Karnataka. Another uncle joined in and echoed the same. I smiled and nodded, saying, “Yes uncle, I’ll learn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in my head, I was thinking, I’m not even staying here long-term… and even if I were, why is learning Kannada a requirement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That interaction left a bitter taste. It didn’t matter that I came from afar and was helping restore their temple—they were more bothered about the language I spoke. For a second, I wondered if it was even worth it. But I shook off those thoughts and reminded myself to stay in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Job Well Done
After three hours of hard work, the temple looked beautiful. Cleaned inside and out, with all the bushes gone, it felt like we had brought something back to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took some group pictures and then had lunch—bisibelebath, curd, chips, and pickle. Maybe the food was genuinely delicious, or maybe we were just famished from the effort. Either way, it hit the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went inside for darshan and pooja. The temple looked divine. The pooja was led by the local priest, and afterward, the community members gave a heartfelt thank-you speech.&lt;/p&gt;

By now it was 5 PM, and we headed to our next stop—a Jain temple in Chikka Hanasoge, about 30 minutes away. From there, we visited several more temples in Saligrama.
Saligrama, we were invited to the home of the family that sponsored our food. They welcomed us warmly and served tea and snacks. We spent some time chatting before heading back to Bangalore around 8 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflections
It was a good day. I made some new friends, had meaningful conversations, and contributed to something worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we returned to Bangalore, everyone grabbed their bikes and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the language gaps and awkward moments, I left with a sense of purpose—and a deeper connection to my community.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>New Flat Relocation</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding a Flat in Bangalore: My Journey from Koramangala to Bellandur
In March 2024, I made a big move in my career—I joined PhonePe, with their office located in Bellandur. At that time, I was living in Koramangala, and although the commute wasn’t too bad initially—roughly 25–35 minutes—I wasn’t in a hurry to relocate. The flat was decent, and the rent was affordable. We were four people sharing the place, each paying around ₹13,000 per month, which later increased to ₹15,000 when the contract was renewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having lived there since May 2023, I had already settled in. I had sorted out the cook, maid, and my routine. So despite the growing traffic, I kept putting off the thought of moving. But over time, the travel time started stretching. Some days, it took an hour just one way, especially in the late morning heat. On top of that, with my flatmates frequently traveling to their hometowns, my share of the expenses kept increasing. That’s when I finally decided it was time to look for a new place closer to work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Old flat Team Royal Apartment koramangla&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flat Hunt Begins: June 2024
I started exploring flats in and around Bellandur, but I quickly realized that most of the options were either too expensive or poorly maintained. After living in apartments for a few years, I wanted to upgrade—somewhere with proper amenities, a gated society, and ideally close to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, my friend Mohit told me about a vacancy in his society, Rohan Iksha. It was a well-maintained society with all the amenities I was looking for. But it was around 4 km from my office—only a slight improvement from my current 5.7 km commute. Given the higher rent, I wasn’t sure it was worth the move and decided to continue searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I lost the motivation to keep looking. But the daily commute kept nagging at me. Some days the traffic was brutal, and I would be stuck in it for hours. Then came a major setback—in late June, I injured my knee badly, which meant surgery and a three-month recovery. The flat hunt came to a complete halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting Back on Track: October 2024
By October, I had recovered and was still in Koramangala, dealing with the same long commutes. Determined to finally move, I started looking again—NoBroker, 99acres, MagicBricks, Flat &amp;amp; Flatmates on Facebook—I tried everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My criteria were clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: Bellandur, Green Glen Layout, or nearby&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pure vegetarian flatmates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gated community with amenities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within budget&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite visiting 10–20 good societies over two months, each one failed to meet some requirement or the other. Then I met two guys through Facebook—one worked at Uber and preferred Sarjapur Road, and the other was in consulting, so location wasn’t a big issue for him. We teamed up and started hunting for a 3BHK together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a couple of weeks, we couldn’t align on a single flat, and eventually, we decided to go our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking Point: Rent Hike and No Progress
Around the same time, one of my flatmates moved out, and our rent shot up to ₹18,000 per head. My other two flatmates shared their room with friends, so they were paying just ₹9,000 each. Suddenly, my room felt not worth the money, and I knew I had to act fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, A Breakthrough: December 2024
It was the end of December, and during a casual chat with Mohit, I asked if there were any new vacancies in his society. To my surprise, he said yes! Within five minutes, I had pictures of the flat. I was so exhausted from the months of flat-hunting that I said yes immediately, without even seeing it in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pictures looked great, the flat was well-maintained, and I trusted the society. It was a bit on the expensive side, and the room with the attached bathroom was already taken, but I was okay with it. I sent the token amount the same day—my hunt was finally over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Flat: Rohan Iksha
I moved into the new flat in January 2025. It’s on the 8th floor, with beautiful French windows and a great view. The flat is in excellent condition, and the society has all the amenities I had been hoping for—gym, pool, security, and a good community vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner is a software engineer, currently living in Bangalore. He bought the flat in 2014 for ₹1 crore, and now it’s valued at around ₹2.5 crores. He’s been responsive and friendly, which is always a plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking Back
Looking back, the journey was long, tiring, and at times frustrating—but it was all worth it. I’m finally living closer to work, in a peaceful and well-maintained society, with a setup that fits my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning to move in Bangalore, especially from Koramangala to Bellandur, here’s what I learned:
Start early, don’t wait for things to get worse
Stick to your priorities, but be flexible
Use all platforms—sometimes the best options come from word of mouth
And most importantly, don’t give up
The traffic in Bangalore won’t change overnight—but your living situation can.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Nandi Hills</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Adventure to Nandi Hills: A Journey of Surprises and Laughter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since Keshav visited Bangalore, and he was about to head back to his hometown. Having recently joined Samsung SDS, where most of the work is remote, staying in Bangalore no longer made sense for him. So, to make the most of his time in the city, we decided to plan a trip. The destination? Nandi Hills. None of us had been there before, and it was about time we checked out this famous spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was simple: leave early, catch the sunrise, and enjoy a peaceful morning at the hilltop. Our group consisted of Keshav, his brother, Mohit, and myself. The excitement was palpable, even though we had heard mixed reviews about Nandi Hills. People often said it was overrated, with no spectacular views or much to see. But we were determined to make our own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to take my car for the trip and aimed to leave by 4 AM so that we could reach Nandi Hills by around 5:30 AM. I woke up at 4 AM, full of excitement, even though I had lived in Bangalore for over two years and had never visited Nandi Hills myself. The morning was cool, and the anticipation of the sunrise made the early start worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge? Waking up everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keshav and his brother were already up, but Mohit, as usual, was still fast asleep. We tried calling him multiple times, but his phone was on Do Not Disturb mode—something he had forgotten to disable. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to rouse him, we decided to leave without him. It wasn’t the ideal start, but we figured we’d meet him later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 4:15 AM, we were on the road, with the city still shrouded in darkness. As expected, Bangalore’s notorious traffic was already in full swing. At 4 AM, seriously? I thought we were in the clear, but the Hebbal Flyover had a surprise in store for us. It was slow-moving, and we couldn’t understand why there was so much congestion at that hour. Eventually, we passed the traffic and headed towards Nandi Hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool breeze was refreshing as we kept the windows down and cruised through the early morning roads. We started reminiscing about old memories, laughing at inside jokes, and getting to know Keshav’s brother better. It felt like one of those perfect road trips that was more about the journey than the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the twist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a wrong turn, thinking we were still on the right path. Instead of heading straight to Nandi Hills, we veered off to the right, which led us on a loop around the entire hill. This detour added another 30 minutes to our drive, but eventually, we reached the entrance to Nandi Hills. The sight that greeted us was a little overwhelming: a long line of cars waiting to climb the hill. There were about 200 cars in line, all trying to ascend the winding roads of the hill. And to make matters more interesting, two-wheelers were bypassing us from the right, squeezing through the narrow gaps to avoid the wait. It was a single-lane road, so only one car could go up at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunger set in, and while we were stuck in the long line, Keshav decided to take matters into his own hands. He got out of the slow-moving car and grabbed us some tea and snacks. There we were, sipping tea in the car while waiting in a traffic jam at 5 AM. We joked that we should’ve brought bikes instead of the car—at least we would’ve saved time. The weather, though, was perfect—cold and refreshing. But just as we were getting comfortable, the rain started. We quickly took back our words; the car was definitely the better choice after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after another 30 minutes of slow progress, we made it to the top of Nandi Hills. The weather had become even more unpredictable, and the fog was so thick that we could barely see a few meters ahead. The road to the top was steep, and the hairpin bends made it feel like a true hill station drive. But with the fog and rain, we couldn’t see much of the beautiful views that we had hoped for. We honked at every corner, just in case another car was coming from the other side, as the road was so narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached the top, we parked the car and stepped out into the misty morning. The security guards and police officers were busy directing cars into parking spots, and the whole place had an eerie, quiet vibe. The fog was so dense that we couldn’t see the sunrise at all—just trees and more fog. The anticipation quickly turned to disappointment, but we made the best of it by laughing at the situation. We ate the snacks Keshav had brought and continued talking about random things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for us to realize that the whole experience was indeed overrated. No sunrise, no sweeping views—just fog, trees, and cold weather. But we weren’t ready to let the trip be a total bust. We decided to take some photos and head back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, our stomachs were growling. We spotted a few roadside eateries that looked promising, and decided to stop at Adyar Ananda Bhavan (A2B) near Rani Circle. The breakfast was delicious, and it felt good to relax after the adventure. While we were enjoying our food, we struck up a conversation with a group of four men sitting at the table next to ours. They were in their 40s or 50s and seemed to be on a road trip as a reunion. They had started their journey from Nagpur and were on their way to Kanyakumari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious about our travels, they asked for some road trip recommendations. It felt nice to share what we knew and swap travel stories with fellow explorers. It was a reminder that no matter where we go, the journey is as much about the people you meet along the way as it is about the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, Keshav took the wheel for the drive back to Bangalore. The mood was light, and we continued to talk about future trips and other places we wanted to explore. The return journey was as fun as the drive to Nandi Hills, and by the time we got back, we were all in good spirits, even if the trip didn’t exactly go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, our trip to Nandi Hills might not have been what we expected, but it was a memorable adventure filled with laughs, a little bit of chaos, and plenty of good stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
