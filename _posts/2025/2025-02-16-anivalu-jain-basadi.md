I m part of a gyanoday bachelors group on whatsapp, it good community in bangalore for all sorts of purposes. the community have several use case such as finding jain flatmates, mostly aroung the gyanoday temple itself, airport ride sharing, wanterers(traveller) group, some mandir volunteering activities, etc. for all young folks to stay connected.

most of the people live right next to the gyanoday temple itself.
since it alway full of msgs i usually check the group once a week with 200-300 msgs, just glimps through them from the surface.
An image caught my attension, it was of a temple, but entire poster was in kannda, so i couldnt understand. Below the image was a caption, final reminder, and that message wali linked to an older msg on the same group. i navigated to the older msg and found the complete descripiton.
it was about restoring an old jain temple, which is kinda lost in the bushes due to no maintanance and lack of jain coominity in that town, it was arounf 300km from bangalore. they had arranged the transport from blr to Anivalu. They found some sponsor for breakfast and lunch but the travel cost must be beared by the entire group.

it sounded interesting to me, its for a great cause and anyways i havent had any plans for the weekend. I curiously msged the admin about more details about this.
he replied instantly, with above description. upon asking timeline, he mentined that we will leave from karnataka jain associan at 6am in the morning.
reach anivalu temple in arounf 4 hour. cleaning might take another 3 hour. then we will visit the temples nearby as well. and we will be back by sunset.

it sounded good, i requested them to take me in as well if they have any seats available. my place was locked. i confirmed if they have any bike parking there, since it will be time consuming to get auto 4:30in the morning.
the trip was starting next day itself. this day, i slept early coz i have to wake up early.


the next day
i woke up at 4:30, since the karnataka jain associan was about 15ish km from my place. i quickly bath and left at arounf 5am from my  place.
it was still dark outside, and i have never been to this part of bangalore earlier. but the feeling was nice, good ealy morning cool breeze, and i was humming some songs cluzing slowly on the roads.

i reached karnatak jain associan, on the entrance itself i see about 20folks, almost all of them are under 25 standing circles. i parked my bike in the basement and came to join the group. i had a pre-assumption in mind that most will be from the bundelkhad, coz the entire gyanday is full of jain from bundelkhad region.
but to my surprise no one from bundelkhad, i tried to communicate a little, but language barrier barged in. 

i went to temple for darshan, in the back of my mind i was thinking kaha fas gaya. i was hoping this will a fun activity where i will meet some new folks. but here, either they were already friend circles, and if not, almost all of them were talking in kannda which i have absolutey no idea about.


our bus was yet to arrive, and we were waiting for several other people to join.

initially the plan was to take breakfast with us and eat on the way. but due to delay and wiaing for several other folks, they changd the plan to leave after havking the breakfast. everyone went inside the dharmshala next to temple to wash hands and came back outside where the breakfst was getting ditributed. some idli and besebellebhat.

i joined the queue and started having breakfast. i saw another guy having breakfast and not interacting with any other folks, i soon realised that he must also be non-kannada thats why. he was looking arounf 5-8 years older to me. while having breakfst, it was getting crowded near the queue, so both of us went to little side to that our food wont get spilled. we started having some small conversations as well. he was from north india and had mostly spent his time outside india and studied in uc berkly university. he worked outside india for some yers then came back to india.


it felt good that even after studying and working in US people are down to earth and ready to make efforts for their community.

after finishing our breakfast and chai everyone sat in the bus.

it was small bus with a capacity fo 50. but only 35-40 seats were occupied.
it was around 7:30am just start our journey. i was damn sure we wont make it back by sunset.

weather was still cozy and leaned towards the wind to take a nap, but he city roads were bumpy, which were constantly making me hit the window.
so i watined for a while till the city roads are over so i can take some rest, i knew the day is gonna get long. i took a nap for about 1-2 hour then bus took a break. those who missed the breakfast started having breakfast. since i already had breakfast i chose not to eat again.
i was stand next to the but itself, and there was a group of yound boys in their early 20s having fun messing around with each other. one of them asked if i was with someone, i said, "no, i came by my self". how the time passed and we started having conversation. so they are regular members of gyanoday abhishek group who go to temple for abhishek daily. onle 4 of them came for this trip. 2 of them are from karnatak itself, and 2 are from north. akkole ji are from sadlaga itself our  guru acharya shri ki's hometown.
