it was 28th of april and we were sitting in office and realise most of us had no plans for the long weekend, since 1st may was a holiday coz of labour day.

as we we were sitting in office we planned to go to kodaikanal.
we initially initially started with 5 folks, me, aditya, vinay, abhay and nithin.
so we distributed the work, i started looking for the car arrangeent, and abhay and aditya were responsibel for the stay.
it turned out we were not the only one looking for car or stay in the kodai kanal all the airbnbs were booked and mere 1-2 overpriced cars were available. i some how arranged a car from my friend who rent cars.
as expected with long weekend, no one in office was in mood to work. we started chit chatting with other mates and fioured out some were heading coorg and some were heading to ooty, blah blha. the point was no one was in blr on the long wekend.
finally we got a good airbnb in kodai, but soon after we booked it, we received a calll, it was the airbnb owner, he called us and asked us that the prpoperty is not available and he can give us another property of his friend. which has a higher price.(we understood what was happending here, he was attracting customer frmo the property images from using his property and then giving them his friend's property, which was not as good and charging more for it, after lot of backand forth discussion we politely declined the offer and started looking for another place. this is typical for airbnb, they try to avooid airbnb comission and try to get customers directly, so they can save the commission and charge more from the customer, this is not the first time this has happened with us, we have faced this multiple times in the past, so we were not surprised.)


now only 1 day lef and we had nothing arranged, we only had a car. soon we realised that other mfs dont even know how to drive.
kodai kanal frmo blr is about 9hr drive, i will be the solo driveer. i can drive 9hrs but not with 4 other people who dont know how to drive.
at least 1 backup in case i get tired. also i wont be able to enjoy the views if i am driving all the time. and i will be tired once i reach there and will have now every lleft to explore the place.

so we changed the plan, cancelled the car and started exploring the options for train or bus.
Bus prices wrere sky high, and train was not available, so we decided 


to try our luck with taktal and lets see what happens.
we booked the tatkal tickets and got the tickets confirmed, we were all set to go.
then nithin backed out due to health issues, so we were left with 4 people.

Finaly we got ticket in waiting and we were all set to go. out stay was kinda kinda finalised, we booked another airbnb which was in front of the lake itself, it was a good property and we were happy with it.

originally our train was to depart around 7pm, so we all se to leave office by 4pm, pack our stuff and head to the station.
As we were heading our from ofdic ei got an sms that the train is 4 hr delayed. we kept our bags back in the office and started doing bakchodi.

finally we all left fomr office packed our bags and headed to the station.
we had to board our train frmo SMVT railway station, whcih was about 1 hr away frmo my location. and since we all live withing 2-3km circle we deviced we will leave by 8pm and picup everyone on the way, and reach the station by 10pm.

Aditya booked the cab and started picking up other people.
first he picked up abhay then vinay, and the next was me.

by this time cab driver got very frustraited and stared asking extra money due to multiple pickups.
we were like bhai we are not going to pay you extra, we have already paid you as per the app, and we are not going to pay you extra.

some heated arguments happend and drived left evryone at vinay's place and left.

so those 3 are at vinays place and i m at my place, we are all set to go, we have our bags packed and ready to go. but since it was light raining no aut was available. smvt was rush place at this time of the day so all auto dirvers were denying.

ater 1hr of waiting i finally got an auto that too with heavy tip. generaly price to the station is 150-200, but i had to pay 600 to get to the station, just beacuse i was running short of time.
same case of others as well, they had to pay 500-600 to get to the station.



finally we all reached the station, then we got to kno the train is delayed by another 1 hrs, so we had to wait at the station for 1 hrs.

we boarded the train and settled in our seats, we had 4 seats in the same compartment, so we were happy.
once we started chatting and having fun, we realised that the train compartment is full and strted to sleep. and in the meanwhiel an uncle shouted at us, that we are making too much noise and we should keep it down. we tryed keeping it low but soone we all slept off.

the next day we woke up at around 6am. so we planned to head to madurai and have breakfast there and see how to reach to kodai frm there. no plans were made for the day, we just wanted to reach kodai and have fun.

while we were on the train we reached a station called kodaikanal road, we were like this is the station for kodai, but we were not sure. we checked on the maps and it was indeed very near to kaodai kanal but we were unsure of the mode of transport to reach kodai from there. so we skipped the plan and sticked to our original plan of reaching madurai and then heading to kodai.

we reached the statiio it was kinda hot and humid, we were not used to this weather, we were used to the cool weather of bangalore. it was9 in the morning and it was already hot, we were already staredt sweating in next 10mins.

we asked aroud and got to know that the best means is to head to bus stand and take a bus to kodai, so we headed to the bus stand, it was about 1km away from the station, we took an auto and reached the bus stand.

we asked aroud for the bus and the lastest bust just left 10mins back and the next bus is in 1hr.
we were anyways hungry so we decided to have breakfast first and then take the bus.
foud a just avg pure veg restaurant in frnt of the bus stand, we had our breakfast and then headed to the bus stand.

we tood the bus and it was a 3hr journey to kodai, we took the last row in the bus to sit together and have fun. it was a bumpy ride, and we were thinking thatnk got nithin did not come, it would have been a nightmare for him and his back.

the ride was about 3 hrs some dozed off and some were enjoying the views.

we reached our destination, kodai kanal, it was a bit chilly and we were happy to be in the cool weather. the 3of my friends offboraded by while i was stepping out the bus started moving, and i dare not to jump out of the bus, so i had to go to the next stop and come back, it was about half a km away, so i walked back to the bus stand and met my friends.


and to plan our sightseeing we started ahving discussion with multiple cab drivers, after noting down few points we decided to take a cab for the day.

but we had to reach to our airbnb first and asked the cab driver to wait for our call we will startr at 5pm.
it was 2pm and we had plenty of time to spare.
we were stainfing next to lake itself and hungry. our stay was 10min walking from that place along the edge of the lake itslef.
and we saw couple of vendors selling corn, raw mango and pineapple. i particularly liked the pineapples, once after the oother we had like 5-10 pineapples, they were so tasty and juicy. i have never had such ripe and juicy pineapples in my life, they were so good that we had to buy more and more. 

after half an hour of eacting corn, pineapple and raw mango we headed to our airbnb. called the manager and he was waiting for us at the property. he handed us the keys and showed us the property, it was a nice property with 2 rooms, it was good for 4 people. we were happy with the property and settled in.

we freshened up and then headed out to explore the place.

Our cab arrived, (we met our amazin cab driver, long story incoming, he is christina and how he quit dirnking after coming under god) and first headed to Vattakanal Waterfalls. clicked some cool photos and videos there, water stream was really really cold, we did not go fully into the water but enjoyed the view and clicked some photos.

after that we headed to dolphin nose view point. there was a small down hie to reach there, but by the time we reached there it was already closed, they stoop allowing people after 5 pm, so we went to neaby mountain viewpoint which has a similar view and we were happy with it. we started clicking photos. after many solo photos we request a bystander to click a group photo and we heard a very familier laugh, it was a colleague from office who was also on a trip to kodai, we were surprised to meet her there. she entered during the main moment of the photo, she joined us in the group photo and left.

After the viewpoint we headed to nearby Altaf Cafe, it was a small cafe with a nice view of the valley and its mostly covered with fog. we ordered some snacks and tea, and enjoyed the view. it was a nice place to relax and enjoy the weather.

After that we headed back to our airbnb, it was already dark and we were tired. we freshened up and went to Hilltop Woodlands Inn pure veg restaurant for dinner, it was a nice place with good food. we ordered some north indian food and it was tasty. 
after dinner we had a craving of dessert, so we headed to a nearby ice cream parlour, it was a small place but they had a good variety of ice creams. we ordered some ice creams and remebered that it was vinays bday some time back, so we ordered a icream cake for him, it was a nice and we enjoyed the cake and ice creams.then we headed back to our airbnb and called it a day.

Since we were heading towards the village are to view step farming and it will be a long ride and sincce we havent had breakfast or lunch we were very hungry, and we asked our cab driver to stop any pure veg restaurant on the way. he stopped at a decent restaurant names Woodys Cafetaria. it looked good and partailly made up of glass wals. we order some itlalian and odered pizza and pasta and lunch for our cab driver as well as per his choice. we were sitting together and his food came first. so it was a joint restaurant bw normal and italian. and you cannot take indian food in tialian sitting area. and waiter arrongntly stopped our cab driver that you are not allowed to sit here with indian food. After a lot of shouting and abuse words bw the restaunt owner and the cab driver we decided its not worth it, let get our food cancelled/parcelled and we will eat it in the cab itself. but the owner was not ready to cancel the order. since it was pre paid so we asked him to parcel yet he was not parcelling food either. our cab driver was very angry and he started shouting at the owner and the owner was also shouting back. it was a heated argument and we were like lets just leave, we dont want to eat here. so we convinced our cab driver to take us away from here and we will eat somewhere else. He asked us whether we got our refund or not, we knew if we say no he will again start the fight, so we said yes we got our refund but he caught our bluff and turned the vahile again and parked int he vehichle in the midle of the mountain road to bloc the road. since it was already a narrow road and so traffic got pile up on both the side. some cab and bus driver cam shouting why is his road blocked in tmail and once he explained the issue to them in brief all came in support to him. now they all dragged the restaurnat owner from collar to the outside or restaurnt and started shouting at him. he was about to be beaten like a dog but we intervened and and politely asked the owner let not escaalne the situation and just give us our food and we will leave. he was not ready to parcel either.

in the mean time police arrived and they started asking questions to the owner and the cab driver. after a lot of back and forth discussion we finally left the place without food and our cab driver was very angry and he made his best efford to make sure the palce get shut down and get no customer frm the taxt union of the kodaikanal.
He was in guilt that it ruied our trip and we were hungry so he took us to all his firnds places some had great soup, some had amazing dosa etc etc. we might had had a break for about 3-4 stops. we also stopped at the opice staion tof ile the fir etc.

Finally we reached the Poomparai village, it was a small village with a lot of greenery and step farming. we walked around the village and clicked some photos. it was a nice place to relax and enjoy the view. There were several camp site as well if anyone want to stay there for relaxing weekend.

We also stopped at a wood house named owl hollow stays, it was a nice place with good veiw.

Finally after all the dram and eventful day we headed back to our airbnb, it was already dark and we were tired. We reached our kodaikanal aroudn 8pm, so we aked our cab driver to drop us at a Hotel Astoria Veg. i saw this restaurant a dayefore and was improessed by the reviews, so we decided to have dinner there. it was a nice place nutil we entered. after 30min of waiting we finally entered and it was so crowded with so less waiters that we had to wait for another 30min to get our order taken. that too was very rude and arrogant. We ordered some small dished it was not that great, but we were so hungry that we had to eat it. 



on the day 3 we woke up early but there was a prod issue going so aditya and vinay had to work, so we decided to stay in the airbnb. after sometime we were getting board so me and abhay decided to head out and explore the lake and nearby area. ther was a 7d theatre it was good experience, we watched a 15 min 7d movie it was fun. soon vinay also joined us so we allwent to boat house and rented a pedal boat. we did some boating and enjoyed the scenic view of the lake. it was a nice and relaxing experience.

We still didnt have any mean to to gog to kodai kaal road railway station, yes this time we decided that that will be closer to us and wll save time.
so we took walked around to find cab back to to kodaikannal road.
and we finaled a cab and started heading to the station. on our way bacck we were having good discussion with the cab driver, he was a nice guy and we were discussing about how his son is studying had and which stream shoud he chose and how much money can he earn in future, and how he does not want him to be like him a cab driver. he was a nice guy and we were having good discussion with him.
Then we stopped at a small veg restaunra to for lunch and to our surprise we met sunny frm PV team there with his family. we had the same train back.
After that once we reache the railway staion we called sunny to ask him where he is, he was at the station itself, we all met his cute son and we all had small chit chat at the station it self. while our train was coming at platfomr 2 we were sitting at the entrance of that station it self since we had time. but once we reached platfomr 2 abhay realise he missed hi bag at the platform1 itself and then abhay and vinay ran to platform 1 to get the bag, while me and aditya were waiting at platform 2. We got the bag. and once the train arrive we boarded the train and settled in our seats. we had 4 seats in the same compartment, so we were happy. we got ot know sunny had rac so ony 1 seat was available. so we asked him to sit with us, so we all sat together and had fun, played uno and cards. Surprisingly aditya was still getting opsgenie calls in the train as well
now some uncle staed comp,aint that we are making too much noise and why light is on. so we reduced noise but since we cant turn off the light we hooke a blanket on at the end of the compartment to block the light, it was a good idea and it worked. After a lot of games we finallay called it a day.

Then in the morning we woke up at around 4am, deboarded the train at Karmelaram railway station, and took an auto to my place. It was a nice trip and we all had fun. We were happy that we went on this trip and explored a new place.
