A Morning Safari Drive ðŸš— 
We kicked off the day with a breezy morning drive south from Bengaluruâ€”excited, slightly sleepy, and definitely hungry. With no time for breakfast, we munched on raw mango slices and cucumber sticks during the ride. As we reached Bannerghatta, we joined the ticket queue for the safari.

Safari at Bannerghatta National Park
Tickets in hand, we boarded the safari vehicle and began our journey through the different zones of Bannerghatta National Park.

Herbivore Safari
Rolling past open grasslands and bamboo patches near rocky hillocks, we spotted a variety of wildlifeâ€”sambar, chital, gaur, barking deer, wild boar, porcupine, pangolin, and even the occasional nilgai.

Bear Safari
In a moated enclosure divided into five zonesâ€”Panchavati, Chitrakuta, Kishkinda, and moreâ€”we glimpsed sloth bears moving about their forest-like habitat.

Lion Safari
Inside a secure, fenced 5-hectare area surrounded by a deep moat, we watched a pride of Asiatic lions roam with a quiet majesty.

Tiger Safari
This zone rotates groups of Bengal and white tigers through holding areas before releasing them into the viewing section. We were luckyâ€”several tigers paced close to our vehicle, offering a thrilling view.

Leopard Sightings
Though elusive, Indian leopards are occasionally spotted by visitors. We kept our eyes peeled, hopeful for a rare glimpse.

The 1â€“2 hour safari took us through broken hillocks, shaded valleys, and lush tropical terrain. The immersive experience felt like a real-life nature documentary.

Bannerghatta Zoo
After the safari, we made our way to the Bannerghatta Zoo. I wasnâ€™t expecting to see giraffes and zebras in Bengaluruâ€”so when I did, I was in awe. It felt surreal to see these iconic African animals so close to home.

We wandered through the enclosures, spotting both exotic and native species. The zoo was more expansive than expected, offering a mix of well-maintained habitats and shaded walking trails. After spending some time exploring, we headed off to our next destination.

The Butterfly Garden
Back at the park, we explored the Butterfly Park, a 7.5-acre conservatory under a domed polycarbonate roof. With a 1 km walking trail, a museum, and a research center, it's home to around 48 species of butterflies observed seasonally. We spotted vibrant flutterers like the Southern Birdwingâ€”Karnatakaâ€™s state butterflyâ€”as well as Crimson Rose and Malabar Rose, dancing among host plants and shallow water trays.

The ambienceâ€”complete with waterfalls, nectar stations, dioramas, and educational videosâ€”was serene and enchanting. Nature at its most delicate and beautiful.

The Parking Lot Mix-Up & Off-Road Detour
As we prepared to leave, a GPS mishap sent Mohit and me on a surprise adventureâ€”a 2â€“3 km off-road detour down a narrow 6-foot-wide stretch. At one point, we had to make a tight U-turn in our new car! Eventually, we found our way back and reunited with Shikhar and Pranika at the rendezvous point.

Benki Falls: The Letdown
From Bannerghatta, we set out for Benki Falls, a 1.5-hour drive away. But when we arrived, we couldnâ€™t find the exact path. Ready to turn back, Shikhar and I decided to explore further on foot. We found a small, steep trail that led us to the falls.

Unfortunately, the "falls" were a disappointmentâ€”the stream was barely a trickle, not the majestic cascade we had envisioned. We took a few photos, shared a quiet laugh at our expectations, and headed back.

Homebound
Tired but content, we ordered dinner from a restaurant on the way and reached home by 8:30 PM. It wasnâ€™t a perfect dayâ€”but it was memorable, unpredictable, and full of stories weâ€™ll be laughing about for a long time.
