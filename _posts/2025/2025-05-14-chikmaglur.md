It had been a long time—too long—since we, a group of old college friends, had hit the road together.

The calendar showed a free weekend on the horizon. I locked in my car reservation without a second thought. The core crew was ready: me, Mohit, Shikhar, and Pranika—Shikhar’s girlfriend. A road trip was brewing.

We reached out to Shikhar’s flatmates—also part of our college gang—but they were already tied up with their own weekend plans. No hard feelings. This trip was happening either way.

We knew we were heading somewhere into the Western Ghats. Lush hills, winding roads, monsoon clouds. But exactly where? That was still a mystery.

It was already Wednesday. The plan: leave early Saturday morning. Destination? Unknown. But the decision to go? Locked in. Jana pakka hai.

Chikmagalur came up first—it always does. But I’d been there too many times to feel excited. I pitched Sakleshpur, but it felt like a sleepy town with not much to offer. Shivmogga came to mind too, but the distance felt like a dealbreaker.

So we played a game of Airbnb roulette.

No good options in Sakleshpur. Nothing exciting in Shivmogga. Chikmagalur it was. We booked a stay right in the heart of the town. Cozy, central, convenient.

With stay and ride sorted, all that remained was the journey.

We decided to leave before the city woke up—to escape the clutches of Bangalore traffic and embrace the serenity of the BLR–Mangalore highway, still quiet in the early light.

Friday night, I packed my bags.

By 4 AM Saturday, alarms rang and the city was still asleep as we stirred to life. Mohit and I, living in the same society, loaded our bags into the car in the stillness of dawn. Then we drove across quiet streets to pick up Shikhar and Pranika. I let mohit drive, as the roads will be empty and he it still getting used to driving.

Ten minutes at their place—bags in, sleepy smiles exchanged—and just like that, at 5:30 AM, the engine roared to life.

Our journey had begun.

we put on some good music, vibing, enjoying the road, and the early morning breeze. The highway was ours, the world still waking up.

I took everyone to my favourite breakfast spot, Hotel Dhruvtare. it was around 150 km from Bangalore, and we reached there by 7:30 AM. We ordered a feast: idli, vada, dosa, and filter coffee. The food was as good as ever, and we savored every bite(service was bit slow coz we sat on the wrong side).

After that we clicked a good group photo, and then we were back on the road.

While driving, i saw a pretty lake so i thought of stopping there, anyways jaldi pahunch ke bhi koi fayda nahi tha. We stopped at a small lake Gavenahalli lake (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ty2RkRkfbTcir4De8)

After spending some time at the lake—breathing in the fresh breeze and taking in the serene views—we hit the road again. It was 10 AM.

Our next stop was the famous Belur Temple, about 45 kilometers away. The drive was smooth, and we reached the temple by 10:30 AM.

We spent around half an hour there, wandering through its intricately carved stone structures and soaking in the centuries of history etched into every pillar. The temple grounds were calm, with just a handful of other visitors, adding to its peaceful aura. We snapped a few photos, took in the beauty one last time, and made our way back to the car, ready for the next leg of the journey.

While checking the map, I spotted a nearby dam, and we decided to make a quick detour. That’s how we ended up at Yagachi Dam, near Belur.

Thanks to the heavy rains, the water level was high, and the dam was overflowing. A steady stream of water cascaded down a 200-meter-long spillway, creating a surreal, almost still-looking flow. All the gates were partially open, revealing the full 32-meter width of the spillway, with about a foot of water gliding smoothly over it.

The entire area was wrapped in lush greenery, with the misty outline of the Western Ghats standing tall in the background. It was quiet, dramatic, and beautiful all at once. We took our time—clicked a bunch of photos, soaked in the view, and just stood there, watching nature do its thing.

Eventually, we got back on the road and cruised toward Chikmagalur. By 12:30 PM, we had reached the town. The drive was effortless, with light rain making the Western Ghats look even more magical.

Our Airbnb, booked through Atheria Hospitality, turned out to be a cozy little spot—clean, welcoming, and most importantly, with enough parking space for 5–6 cars. That was a win in itself. We unloaded our bags, took a quick break to freshen up, and then set out to explore Chikmagalur.

Our first stop was Shri Deviramma Temple, a small yet beautiful temple tucked right in the heart of the town. It was quiet, with just a few locals around, which made the visit feel calm and personal. We spent some time there, taking in the peaceful atmosphere and snapping plenty of photos—the mountain behind the temple was a stunning sight, almost completely wrapped in clouds.

A light drizzle began as we stood there, adding a gentle, misty charm to the entire scene. It felt like the weather itself was setting the mood for us.

Next, we made our way to Kallathigiri Falls. There’s a temple near the falls too, but we were more drawn to the waterfall itself. The drive there was stunning—lush greenery all around, the winding roads of the Western Ghats, and a steady drizzle that made everything look like a painting in motion.

We reached the falls around 5 PM. The water flowed down in powerful sheets, mist rising with every crash. We spent some time there, clicking photos, taking it all in, and letting the sound of the falls drown out the world for a while.

Afterwards, hunger started to kick in. We began heading back toward town, looking for a quick bite. That’s when we spotted a tiny roadside stall selling bhutta (roasted corn). It was raining hard, but something about that little stall called to us.

We stopped. Ordered bhutta. And it turned out to be absolutely perfect—charred just right, smeared with butter, lime, salt, and masala. We stood there under the makeshift tin roof, holding steaming hot corn in our hands as rain poured down around us.

It was such a simple moment, but unforgettable. With the cold wind, the warmth of the roasted corn, and the smell of rain on earth—it felt straight out of a movie. The kind of moment you don’t plan, but end up remembering forever.

We reached back to town by around 7 PM. Pranika wasn’t feeling too well, so we decided it was best to return to the Airbnb and rest for a bit.
On the way, I knew a small lake nearby and thought of squeezing in one last spot before calling it a day. But as luck would have it, the entry gate had closed at 6 PM. So, we made a quick U-turn and headed straight back to the stay.
Despite the change in plans, it didn’t matter much—the day had been well spent. From serene temples to roaring waterfalls, scenic drives to hot bhutta in the rain—it was everything a monsoon road trip in the Western Ghats should be.
