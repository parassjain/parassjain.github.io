Finding a Flat in Bangalore: My Journey from Koramangala to Bellandur
In March 2024, I made a big move in my career—I joined PhonePe, with their office located in Bellandur. At that time, I was living in Koramangala, and although the commute wasn't too bad initially—roughly 25–35 minutes—I wasn’t in a hurry to relocate. The flat was decent, and the rent was affordable. We were four people sharing the place, each paying around ₹13,000 per month, which later increased to ₹15,000 when the contract was renewed.

Having lived there since May 2023, I had already settled in. I had sorted out the cook, maid, and my routine. So despite the growing traffic, I kept putting off the thought of moving. But over time, the travel time started stretching. Some days, it took an hour just one way, especially in the late morning heat. On top of that, with my flatmates frequently traveling to their hometowns, my share of the expenses kept increasing. That’s when I finally decided it was time to look for a new place closer to work.

The Flat Hunt Begins: June 2024
I started exploring flats in and around Bellandur, but I quickly realized that most of the options were either too expensive or poorly maintained. After living in apartments for a few years, I wanted to upgrade—somewhere with proper amenities, a gated society, and ideally close to the office.

Around the same time, my friend Mohit told me about a vacancy in his society, Rohan Iksha. It was a well-maintained society with all the amenities I was looking for. But it was around 4 km from my office—only a slight improvement from my current 5.7 km commute. Given the higher rent, I wasn’t sure it was worth the move and decided to continue searching.

Eventually, I lost the motivation to keep looking. But the daily commute kept nagging at me. Some days the traffic was brutal, and I would be stuck in it for hours. Then came a major setback—in late June, I injured my knee badly, which meant surgery and a three-month recovery. The flat hunt came to a complete halt.

Getting Back on Track: October 2024
By October, I had recovered and was still in Koramangala, dealing with the same long commutes. Determined to finally move, I started looking again—NoBroker, 99acres, MagicBricks, Flat & Flatmates on Facebook—I tried everything.

My criteria were clear:

Location: Bellandur, Green Glen Layout, or nearby

Pure vegetarian flatmates

A gated community with amenities

Within budget

Despite visiting 10–20 good societies over two months, each one failed to meet some requirement or the other. Then I met two guys through Facebook—one worked at Uber and preferred Sarjapur Road, and the other was in consulting, so location wasn’t a big issue for him. We teamed up and started hunting for a 3BHK together.

But after a couple of weeks, we couldn’t align on a single flat, and eventually, we decided to go our separate ways.

Breaking Point: Rent Hike and No Progress
Around the same time, one of my flatmates moved out, and our rent shot up to ₹18,000 per head. My other two flatmates shared their room with friends, so they were paying just ₹9,000 each. Suddenly, my room felt not worth the money, and I knew I had to act fast.

Finally, A Breakthrough: December 2024
It was the end of December, and during a casual chat with Mohit, I asked if there were any new vacancies in his society. To my surprise, he said yes! Within five minutes, I had pictures of the flat. I was so exhausted from the months of flat-hunting that I said yes immediately, without even seeing it in person.

The pictures looked great, the flat was well-maintained, and I trusted the society. It was a bit on the expensive side, and the room with the attached bathroom was already taken, but I was okay with it. I sent the token amount the same day—my hunt was finally over.

The New Flat: Rohan Iksha
I moved into the new flat in January 2025. It’s on the 8th floor, with beautiful French windows and a great view. The flat is in excellent condition, and the society has all the amenities I had been hoping for—gym, pool, security, and a good community vibe.

The owner is a software engineer, currently living in Bangalore. He bought the flat in 2014 for ₹1 crore, and now it’s valued at around ₹2.5 crores. He’s been responsive and friendly, which is always a plus.

Looking Back
Looking back, the journey was long, tiring, and at times frustrating—but it was all worth it. I’m finally living closer to work, in a peaceful and well-maintained society, with a setup that fits my lifestyle.

If you're planning to move in Bangalore, especially from Koramangala to Bellandur, here's what I learned:

Start early, don't wait for things to get worse

Stick to your priorities, but be flexible

Use all platforms—sometimes the best options come from word of mouth

And most importantly, don’t give up

The traffic in Bangalore won’t change overnight—but your living situation can.
