After months of meticulous planning and a few inevitable delays, the day had finally arrived for our much-anticipated road trip. The journey, which commenced on the 6th of January 2024, began with a slight hiccup ‚Äì our early morning start at 5:30 am was pushed back to 6:30 am. Nevertheless, the excitement was palpable as it was me, Jaideep, Himanshu, and his friend embarking on this adventure together.

Our route? Bangalore to an undisclosed destination via Tumkur Road. The roads welcomed us with their smooth surface, allowing us to maintain a comfortable speed throughout the journey. Our strategy was to make brief stops after each toll booth, ensuring we could stretch our legs and enjoy the ride even more.

One of our planned pit stops was the renowned hotel, Dhruvathare, approximately 100 kilometers from Bangalore. Having visited there previously with the BMW group, I knew we were in for a treat. Arriving at 8:30 am, we indulged in a hearty breakfast, surrounded by an array of impressive bikes ‚Äì ZX10R, Ducati, Harley, and more. The symphony of engines as another group of bikers rolled in added to the overall experience.

Resuming our journey around 9:30 am, we relied on Google Maps for navigation. The roads remained favorable, enabling us to maintain speeds between 100-120 kmph. However, I opted for a more leisurely pace of 80-90 kmph, savoring the ride, the scenic views, and the harmonious purr of the engine.

As my companions sped ahead, I relished the journey, capturing the picturesque landscapes with my GoPro since stopping for pictures proved challenging. With lakes and mountains dotting the route, every twist and turn brought a new visual delight.

Understanding that our destination awaited after a 6-hour ride, we decided against unnecessary delays and pressed on. After covering 200 kilometers, a kaccha road lay ahead ‚Äì a bit bumpy but compensated by breathtaking views. Though it slowed us down a tad, we managed to maintain a respectable speed, keeping the spirit of adventure alive.

Our road trip took an unexpected turn when Rahul, navigating with his Apple Maps, got lost and ended up on a toll-free route due to some quirky settings. Despite the detour, we finally arrived at our destination by 11:30 am ‚Äì a Holiday Inn that surprised us with a spacious 2 BHK apartment complete with a kitchen and living room.

After a satisfying lunch and a brief rest, our eagerness to explore prompted us to venture out. Initially considering Hebbe Falls, we decided on Mullayanagiri instead, given the proximity and the limited time available ‚Äì it was already 3:30 pm.

Underestimating the weather, I opted for just a t-shirt, a choice that would have consequences later on. Leaving the hotel at 4:00 pm, we entered the mountainous terrain, encountering a checkpoint where a nominal fee of 10rs per bike was required. As I waited for my companions, I marveled at the amazing roads ahead.

The road unfolded like a dream, offering a perfect mix of flat stretches and thrilling curves. Leaning into the turns, we enjoyed a 3-4 km stretch of pure excitement. The adrenaline rush was undeniable.

As we ascended further, the temperature dropped, and I began to feel the chill. Unlike my companions, who were clad in full jackets, I persisted with just a t-shirt. Within 15 minutes, we reached the pinnacle of our journey ‚Äì the Mullayanagiri peak.

Cloaked in clouds, the peak presented an ethereal sight. Undeterred, we purchased corn cobs and ascended the 500 steps leading to the top. The chill intensified as we climbed, and despite missing the sunset due to the thick clouds, the experience was nothing short of captivating.

Exploring a small trail branching off from the peak, we found a serene spot to sit and absorb the surroundings. For the next 30-40 minutes, we enjoyed the tranquility, engaging in lively conversations, clicking pictures, and reveling in the sheer beauty of the moment.

Our unexpected detours and spontaneous decisions had led us to a destination filled with surprises, creating memories that would be etched in our minds forever. The journey was far from over, and the anticipation of what lay ahead added a sense of excitement to our already exhilarating road trip. Stay tuned for more tales from our adventure!

As we descended from the breathtaking heights of Mullayanagiri, the crisp mountain air embraced us, and the cold set in. Walking back to the parking area, we witnessed rainfall in the distance ‚Äì a mesmerizing spectacle that added to the enchantment of the journey.

A striking panorama unfolded before us, with half the mountain shrouded in clouds while the other half stood clear. Capturing the moment through a series of photographs, we bid farewell to the peak and embarked on our journey back.

The impending rain caught up with us as we reached the bikes. Undeterred by the weather, we revved our engines and set off. The ride back, amidst the cold and drizzle, proved to be an invigorating experience. By 7:30 pm, we safely returned to our hotel, marking the end of a day filled with adventure.

After a hearty dinner ‚Äì with me opting for a delightful pure-veg experience at a nearby restaurant ‚Äì the group decided to unwind with some whiskey. Being a non-drinker, I retired to my room for a restful night's sleep.

The next morning, plans to explore Hebbe Falls were abandoned as everyone succumbed to the temptation of sleep. Rising at 9:00 am, we had a leisurely breakfast before commencing our journey back to Bangalore.

Our encounter with a gracious hotel staff member or owner left a lasting impression. Armed with valuable insights on scenic routes and hidden gems, we decided to deviate from the direct highway route and explore a path through the jungle.

Embarking at 10:00 am, the cold morning air greeted us as we traversed pristine roads. Entering the jungle, the surroundings transformed into a visual spectacle. Slowing down to 40 kmph, we immersed ourselves in the serenity ‚Äì the curves, the dense forest, the refreshing breeze, and the harmonious bird songs created an idyllic ambiance.

Alone on that secluded road, we relished the tranquility. After a 30-minute ride, we reached a small temple, adding a touch of spiritual enrichment to our journey.

By 1:30 pm, we contemplated visiting another waterfall, about 20 kilometers away. However, a catch awaited us ‚Äì a mandatory 3-hour safari to reach the destination. Undeterred, we faced the decision: to embark on a more extended exploration or return to the familiar highways. The allure of the unknown won, and we set forth on the jungle path, eager to uncover more of nature's wonders.

As the decision loomed between an extended exploration and a timely return to Bangalore, the allure of reaching home by 8 pm won over the prospect of a late-night arrival at 11 pm. Concerned about navigating in the dark, I opted to skip the waterfall safari, while the rest of the group decided to indulge in the adventure.

Setting off on my solo journey back to Bangalore, the changing landscape every 20 kilometers kept the ride intriguing. Determined not to drive in the dark, I savored the ever-evolving scenery.

A pit stop at a quaint dhaba for lunch provided a welcome break. Curious about my friends' progress, I contacted Himanshu only to learn that they had witnessed the crowd at the waterfall, promptly turning back. The unexpected turn of events placed them 45 minutes behind me.

Approaching Shravanbelagola, the sight of the highway brought relief and joy. As I joined the highway, my average speed increased to 100-110 kmph. Realizing the importance of pacing myself, I adjusted to 80-90 kmph to avoid fatigue.

The straight stretches allowed me to cover substantial ground, enjoying the freedom to stop whenever I pleased. Brief breaks every 50-60 kilometers included leg stretches, hydration, and the rejuvenating pause of chai.

Encountering a fellow Himalayan rider en route to Bangalore, we silently shared the road, a camaraderie intrinsic to the biking community. Riding together from 5:30 pm until sunset, I reduced my speed as darkness set in, maintaining a safe distance. At a point, he forged ahead, and I slowed down, prioritizing safety over speed in the night.

Reaching the familiar comforts of home at 7:30 pm, the weariness was overshadowed by a sense of accomplishment. The journey had been tiring, yet immensely rewarding. Navigating through unknown roads, encountering unexpected twists, and relishing the freedom of the open highway had transformed a simple road trip into an unforgettable adventure. As I parked the bike and reflected on the day's exploits, I couldn't help but smile ‚Äì for every fatigue, there was a tale of triumph, making it a ride to remember.
