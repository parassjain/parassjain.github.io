- 150km road trip from kochi to munnar on 2 scooters.
- The journey was filled with scenic views, tea plantations, and a buttery smooth ride.
- The weather was perfect, and the roads were almost empty.
- We stopped at a few places to take pictures and enjoy the view.
- munnar tea plantation was a treat to the eyes, they looked like a green carpet, exactly like the ones we see in movies.
- We reached munnar by 2 pm and had some local food.
- we started our journey back to kochi by 4 pm.
