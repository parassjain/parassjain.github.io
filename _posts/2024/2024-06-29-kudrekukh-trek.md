I planned this trek with the BMC Adventure Club, having previously done the Kumaraparvatha trek with them. Our journey began with an overnight bus ride from Bangalore to Kudremukh, reaching the base camp at 6 AM. A warm breakfast of chai and idli set the tone for the adventure ahead.


By 6:30 AM, we started the trek. Monsoon season made the trail extremely slippery and infested with leeches. Since I wasn’t prepared for leeches, I felt a bit nervous. Another trekking group was headed to Vali Kunja Trek, which is even more notorious for leeches. They were well-prepared with leech socks and leech guards, making me second-guess my own preparedness. Despite the initial hesitation, I decided to push forward.

A jeep dropped us off at the starting point, and from there, it was a 7 km trek that took us around 4 hours to reach the top. The trail meandered through dense forests, and soon, it started to drizzle, making the terrain even trickier.


I started chatting with my fellow trekkers—some from Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi—and we bonded over shared trekking experiences. Our first break was for instructions, and while standing still, I realized a leech had latched onto my shoe. My left foot was bleeding, but I couldn’t even find the leech! The anticoagulant it released meant the bleeding wouldn’t stop quickly. Tightening my shoelaces, I pressed on.


The higher we climbed, the better the views became. Lush green grasslands, misty valleys, and the occasional sunlight filtering through made for some breathtaking sights. We took a break at benches along the way, where I shared my dry fruits and snacks with the team. These quick energy boosters were much needed.

The mid 2km were mosly flat and easy. The last 2 km were the most challenging, with a steep incline that tested our endurance. As the rain stopped, we found ourselves walking in a dense mist, with rolling hills and valleys below, eerily resembling the Windows XP wallpaper. Once we conquered the steep ascent, it was a flat walk leading to the summit, where the landscape transformed into a mix of grasslands on one side and dense forest on the other.


At the top, it was incredibly windy, and the clouds passed right through us. With limited visibility, we could barely see 5 feet ahead, but the thrill of being at the peak was exhilarating. We settled down to enjoy our packed lunches, a meal that tasted even better after the grueling climb.


The descent began post-lunch, but my wet socks made me feel cold. Luckily, my past trekking experiences had taught me to pack extra socks, so I changed into a dry pair. Initially, the descent was sunny, offering spectacular valley views, but soon, it started raining again.

The trail quickly turned into a water slide, requiring extreme caution. Each step had to be calculated to avoid slipping. A local guide showed us how to maneuver through the challenging terrain. After two hours of descending, the trail became repetitive, and exhaustion set in—it felt like a never-ending flight with the same view of clouds.

I picked up my pace and reached the base camp by 6 PM, where a hot cup of chai and snacks awaited us.


The Kudremukh Trek was an incredible experience, balancing challenges and scenic rewards. It’s not the toughest trek, but the slippery trails and leeches make it unique. If you plan to do this trek, I highly recommend:

- Wearing leech socks and carrying salt
- Packing extra socks
- Carrying dry fruits or energy bars for quick refueling
- Preparing for rain and slippery conditions

After a long day, we stayed at a homestay nestled in the mountains, where the views were breathtaking, even though the food was just okay. We had a hearty dinner and called it a night, wrapping up an adventure to remember.

The next day, before heading back to Bangalore, we went to Belur, home to the famous Chennakesava Temple, an architectural masterpiece from the Hoysala era. The temple's intricate carvings and grandeur left us mesmerized. Walking through the beautifully sculpted halls, we admired the detailed stonework depicting mythological stories. Spending some time soaking in the history and artistry of the temple provided a peaceful end to our adventurous weekend.
