Sometimes, the best trips are the ones you don’t plan. That’s exactly how our bike ride to Krishnagiri Dam happened.

It was a Saturday morning in June, and the weather was perfect for a ride—cool breeze, empty roads, and the promise of adventure. I started early, made a quick stop at the petrol pump to fuel up, and then headed to my friends' place to pick them up. Since Jaideep and Himanshu live in the same flat, the meetup was quick, and by 8 AM, we were rolling.

Our first stop? A2B restaurant for a hearty breakfast. Fresh idlis, crispy vadas, and a steaming cup of filter coffee later, we were back on the road.

This time, Jaideep and I decided to switch bikes. I hopped on his BMW G310R, while he took my BMW 310RR. The difference was striking. The G310R had an upright seating position, making it super comfortable—almost like floating on a cloud. I was effortlessly cruising at 90-100 kmph. In contrast, my 310RR feels aggressive, planted, and lets you feel every bit of the road. It was fun experiencing both styles, but after 10-20 km, we switched back to our own bikes.

By 11:30 AM, we arrived at Krishnagiri Dam. To be honest, the dam itself was just okay—nothing extraordinary. A few locals were bathing in the reservoir, and the place had a laid-back vibe.

But what caught me off guard was the massive garden next to the dam. I wasn’t expecting much, but it turned out to be huge, with a deer park, children's play area, and several families enjoying picnics.

We found a big rock under a tree, parked ourselves there, stretched our legs, and took some photos. My friends, tired from the ride, decided to just sit and relax. But I was curious—I wanted to get a better view.

Leaving my friends behind, I crossed the garden and made my way to the dam wall. To get there, I had to climb a long flight of stairs. It took me a minute or so to reach the top, but the view was worth it.

The entire dam wall was painted blue and white, creating a stunning contrast against the emerald-blue water shimmering in the midday sun. The reflection made the reservoir look surreal. It was blazing hot, and I could barely keep my eyes open under the bright sun.

A kind gentleman noticed me struggling with selfies and offered to click some pictures. And that’s how I got my perfect shot, standing on the dam wall, soaking in the view of Krishnagiri Dam.

After spending some time enjoying the view, I climbed back down, rejoined my friends, and we geared up for the ride back. The return journey was just as fun, with the open roads and cool wind making the ride even more enjoyable.

A spontaneous plan, great company, and a ride through beautiful roads—what more could a biker ask for?
