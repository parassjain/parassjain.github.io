- [Neriamangalam Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q8GHzCF375nxKRMy5) is a bridge that connects the mainland with the high ranges of Kerala. It is a gateway to Munnar.
- we passed this bridge on the way to Munnar.
- we stopped our scooty to take a good view lake below the bridge.
- The view from the bridge was breathtaking.
- the bridge was super narrow and 2 cars could barely pass each other.
- while the road was empty, we took a few photos and videos.
- whle enjoying the cool breeze we forgot that we were standing on a narrow bridge.
- suddenly a truck was passing next to us, literally the tyrs and its bolts passed less than 1 cm from our feet.
- either the truck driver was expert or we were lucky, but we survived.
- we were scared to death and it took us 2 min to reaadlied that we just dodged death.
- after looking at each other, we laughed and moved on.
- we continued out juorney to Munnar.

- while coming back from Munnar, we reached the same bridge.
- the time was of sunset, and we were cautious this time while clicking pics.
- we clicked some good pics and videos.
- we then went to the boat house down the bridge.
- we bridge was looking magnificent from the boat house.
- to pass some time at the boat house we started bouncing some stones in the water.
- we again continued our journey back to Kochi.
