Trekking is a refreshing alternative to the usual weekend routine of getting drunk. After several failed attempts, we finally secured tickets for the highly sought-after sunrise trek near Bangalore, scheduled for March 24th. Our group consisted of Mohit, Shikhar, Nandu, Utkarsh, Siddhi, Hetvee, and myself, all eager for the adventure ahead.

The Early Start
To ensure an early start, I decided to stay over at Mohitâ€™s place. We needed to be up by 2 AM, so it made sense to minimize travel time in the morning. At 2:30 AM, we set off from Mohitâ€™s place, joined by Shikhar and Utkarsh. Our next stop was Nanduâ€™s house, where Siddhi and Hetvee joined us. By 3 AM, we were on the highway, leaving Bangalore behind.

The road was empty and the night sky pitch dark. Our convoy, comprising two cars, one driven by Nandu and the other by Utkarsh, felt like the only souls on the road. We made a quick stop at a roadside Maggi point for some hot Maggi and tea to combat the cold. After a 30-minute break, we resumed our journey and reached the base of the hill by 4 AM.

The Trek Begins
Upon arrival, we encountered a long queue at the trek's entry point. It seemed like every adventurer in Bangalore had the same idea. We parked our cars and joined the slow-moving line, eager to start our ascent. Flashlights in hand, we began the trek in the darkness.

The initial steep climb left me drenched in sweat and feeling exhausted, but the good news was that the toughest part was over. The path leveled out, making the hike more manageable. I found myself ahead of the group and struck up a conversation with Hetvee, whom I hadnâ€™t met before. The sky began to lighten, signaling that we were nearing the peak.

Reaching the Peak
By 5:30 AM, we reached the summit, greeted by a breathtaking sunrise. The view was worth every drop of sweat and every step taken. We spent time capturing the moment with numerous photos. Seeking a moment of solitude, I found a small rock to sit on and take in the stunning scenery. The combination of cold wind and warm sunshine on my face was perfect.

After about 30 minutes at the top, we decided to descend. On our way down, we noticed several groups making their way up, confirming our satisfaction with the early start. Among them were two girls who impressively ran down the hill, leaving us in awe of their speed.

The Return Journey
We descended by 7 AM, feeling sleep-deprived, hungry, and tired. Luckily, there was a small shop at the foothill selling coconut water and snacks. We quenched our thirst with sugarcane juice and coconut water, and grabbed some snacks.

At this point, we realized that Utkarsh was missing. Being new to trekking, he was descending at a slower pace. He caught up with us after about 10 minutes, and we headed back to Bangalore.

Initially, we planned to stop for breakfast at a dhaba on the highway. However, everyone fell asleep in the car, so we skipped the plan and drove straight to Mohitâ€™s place. We arrived around 9 AM, and I immediately fell asleep in the hall. I woke up at 11 AM, had some breakfast, and then headed back home.
