- this trek was quite famous in Bangalore, tickets get full 2-3 weeks before the trek
- after several failed attempt we finally for the ticket for 24th march.
- mohit, shikhar, nandu, urkatsh, siddhi, hetvee joined me on the trek.
- its better to do trek then getting drunk on weekends
- we arranges two cars, one brought by nanadu, and another by utkarsh.
- since we need to to be up bu 2am, i decided to stay at mohits place
- we started at 2:30 am from mohits place, shikhar and utkarsh also came to mohits place
- then we went to nanadus place to pick him up, where siddhi and hetvee accompanied us.
- in 20 min or so, we left bangalore and were on the highway
- it was pitch dark outside, and the road was empty, we were the only car on the road.
- we stopped at a maggi point to have some maggi and tea. it was a bit cold outside.
- after 30 mins of break we started again, and reached the base of the hill by 4 am.
- ther was a huge queue at the entry if trek by namma trek etc and some other groups. looks like every person in bangalore wants to do this sunrise trek.
- we parked our cars and joined the queue, it was moving very slowly.
- we then started the trek, it was dark, and we had to use our flashlight to see the path.
- on our way we saw several groups as well, while they were taking breaks we kept on moving.
- at this point of time i was completely drenched in sweat, and was feeling very tired. we had only covered half of the trek.
- good part was that the steep part was over, and now we were walking on a flat surface.
- i was ahead of the group, soon other joined. since i havent met hetvee before, we had a good chat while walking.
- we could see the sky getting brighter, and we were getting closer to the peak.
- we reached the peak by 5:30 am, and the view was amazing. we could see the sun rising from the horizon.
- we clicked several photos.
- i went to find some solaace, and found a small rock to sit on.
- it was very windy at the top, and i was feeling cold.
- but the sunshine on the face with cold wind was a perfect combination.
- we stayed at the top for 30 mins or so, and then started to descend.
- while decending we saw several groups coming up, and we were happy that we started early.
- and damn, these two grials were so fast, they were running down the hill. we could barely keep up with them.
- we descended the hill by 7 am. 
- so we were sleep deprived, hungry and tired.
- thankfully, on the foothill there was a small shop which was selling coconut water, and some snacks.
- we had sugarcane juice, coconut water and some snacks.
- soon we reallied that we were 1 person short, and utkarsh was missing.
- since it was his first trek, he was not used to the trekking, and decending at low pace.
- he joined us in 10 mins or so, and we left for bangalore.
- we decided to have breakfast at a small dhaba on the highway, but everyone was already asleep in the car, so we ditched the plan and headed back to mohits place.
- we reached mohits place by 9 am, and i was feeling very sleepy. i dozed off in the hall it self.
- i woke up at 11 am, and we had some breakfast, and then i left for my place.
