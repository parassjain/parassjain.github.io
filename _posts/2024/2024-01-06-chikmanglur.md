- we reached there at around 8:30 am and had a good breakfast
- there were some amazing bikes parked there, zx10r, ducati, harley, etc. while we were having breakfast, a group of bikers came in and parked their bikes, the sound of the engines was pure joy
- we started again at around 9:30 am, since i had not been on road afther this rouce, we all started google maps.
- the roads were pretty good, we could easily maintain a speed of 100-120 kmph but i choose not to go above 80-90 kmph.
- they all were riding ahead of me, i was enjoying the ride and the view and the sound of the engine
- i can spot some beautiful lakes and mountains on the way but i was not able to stop and take pictures, i had them in my gopro
- since it was a 6 hr ride, we decided not to waste any time and reach the destination as soon as possible
- after 200km, we had to take kaccha road, it was a bit bumpy but the view was amazing, it hindered our speed a bit but we were able to maintain a good speed
- Rahul got lost and took road with no tolls, coz of some weired setting in his apple maps.
- at 11:30is we reached our hotel, it was a holiday inn. it was a 2 bhk apartment with a kitchen and a living room. it was pretty good.
- we had a good lunch and rested for a while. i took a short nap and then we decided to go out
- below is the pic of things to explore there
- first we were thinking of going to hebbe falls but then we decided to go to mullayanagiri, coz hebbe falls was 60km from our hotel and it was already 3:30 pm.
- i thought, and i quote that it was a warm weather so i decided to wear just a tshirt. it costed me on the way back.
- we left our hotel at 4:00pm, entered the mountain curve in 15 min oor so. there was a checpost where we had to pay 10rs per bike. i reached there early but i was not haing any cash so i waited for them to come. them we moved on.
- the road was super super amazing. so it was almost flat with the curves. we all were leaning the bikes on the curves, it was so much fun. it was a 3-4 km patch where we went zoom zoom leaning left then right then left then right. it was so much fun.
- after that i can feel the cold breeze, i was shivering a bit. others were wearing full jacket and i was wearing just a tshirt.
- in nest 15mins we reached the mulyangiri peak.
- it was completely convered with clouds, we bought corn cobs and started walking towards the peak. there are 500 steps to reach the peak. we started walking and it was getting colder and colder.
- we clicked several pictures on the way.
- ne 15 min we reached the peak, it was completely covered with clouds. we could not see anything. we were not able to see the sun set. it was a bit disappointing but it was a good experience.
- we went to a small trail going sidewars from the top, there we sat nd enjoyed the view. it was so peaceful. we sat there for 30-40 mins. clicked a lot of pictures and had some fun conversations.
- then we started walking back to the parking. it was cold.we could see some rainfall hapenning far away from the peak. it was a good view.
- there was an aming view where half of the mountain was covered with clouds and half was clear. it was a good view.
- after reaching the parking space we clicked several pic of bikes then we started our journey back.
- rainy clouds almost reached us. it was getting super cold, we revved our engines and started moving. it was a good ride back. we reached our hotel at around 7:30 pm.
- then had some dinner, 2 of them were non vegetarin, so i went to a nearby pure-veg restaurant and had some amazing dalmakhni there.
- they bought some whiskey, since i dont drink, i went to my room and slept.
- next we had to conver hebbe falls, but eveypine was so sleepy in the morning we ditched and kept sleeping.
- we woke up at 9:00 am, had breakfast and started our journey back to bangalore.
- then we met an amazing uncle on the reception, i eblieve he was member of staff or owner of the hotel. he was so nice and humble. he told us about the places to visit and the roads to take. he was so nice.
- so instead of taking the direct highway to bangalore we took the route via jungle were we could cover a temple, a small waterfall and some other places.
- i was linke, we have come so far, lets explore a bit more. and i am glad we did.
- it was a cold morning, we started our journey at 10:00 am. the roads were good.
- soon we entered the jungle and the view were just so wow i reduced my speed to 40 and enjoyed every bit of it.
- the curves, in the forest completely covered with trees, the cold breezz on the fece, the humming sound of birds, it was so peaceful.
- we were on the only vehicle on that road.
- after 30 min ride we reached the temple, it was a small temple, it was a good experice.
- it was already 1:30om. there was another waterfall nearby 20ish km, but there was a catch. there we had to take a safari which will take 3 hours minimum.
- so if we skip it we can reach banaglore by 8pm, but if we go there we will reach by 11pm.
- i was not in the favour of driving in the dark, so i decided to skip it. they all went fo the safari and i started my journey back to bangalore.
- the road was good, i see the landscpace changing completely after evey 20 km. it was a good ride.
- i stopped at a small dhaba for lunch, it was a good lunch. i contacted himanshu to know about their status, and they went there saw the rush and came back. it was so funny. so technically they were 45 min behind me.
- by the time i had reached near shravanbelagola, i can see the highway. i was so happy to see the highway.
- once i hopped on the highway, my avg speed increased to 100-110kmph. after 15min or so, i realised is should not be riding fast, since riding fast will make your tired faster, so i reduced my speed to 80-90kmph.
- the roads were straight and i covered a lot if distance in the short span. since i was riding along i had the liberty to stop wherever i wanted to. i stopped after every 50-60km for a short break. stretched my legs, had some water and started again.
- took some chai breaks as well. it keeps us energetic. otherwise i would feel super tired while reaching home.
- i met a himalyan rider on the way, he was going to bangalore too. we didnt talk or anything, it was just a rider thing, we just keep moving together. we ride together from 5:30 till sunset. after that i reduced my speed and he went ahead. i dont spped when i cant see the road. it was already dark and i was 50km from bangalore.
- i reached home at 7:30pm. it was a good ride. i was tired but it was a good ride.
