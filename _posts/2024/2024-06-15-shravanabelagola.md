It had been a while since I last visited Shravanabelagola. Someone in our Gyanoday group mentioned they wanted to visit the place and were looking for company. On the same day, four of us connected over WhatsApp and decided to go on a road trip to see Bahubali’s statue.

We booked a Zoomcar for the trip. I received the car at 4:30 AM and began picking up the group—first Shuchita, then Saloni, and finally another friend near Marathahalli. By the time we left Bangalore, it was already 6:30 AM.


On our way, we stopped for breakfast at Sambharam, a restaurant near the highway. We had idli, dosa, and tea. The food was delicious, and the service was quick. By 7:30 AM, we were back on the road.


I drove the entire way since I was the only one comfortable driving. Though Shuchita knew how to drive, she preferred not to at that moment. We reached Shravanabelagola at 9:00 AM. I quickly parked the car, and we started climbing the hill. By 9:30 AM, we reached the temple.

Visiting Bahubali’s statue is always a unique experience—no matter how many times I see it, it feels like the first time. The grandeur and serenity of the place make every problem in life seem insignificant. We spent some time there, even video-calling my parents to give them a virtual darshan. At 11:00 AM, we left the temple and explored some nearby temples as well.

we had enough time till evening so we left to visit some lake Kikkeri Kere and waterfall nearby. 

the roads and the road was amazong, lush green roads full of trees, they forming canopy over the road.
we stopped there and clicked several photos.

We reached the lake at 1:30 PM. We spent some time there. the lake was bit disappointing, so checjed on google maps a found a way which was passing thought eh middle of the lake.
we took our car there and it was really good. a narrow path, just enough for a single car to pass.
both sides of the road were covered with water. We put on some music and stayed there for a while, enjoying the breeze.
after cliking a lot of photos, we left the place at 2:00 PM.

Next stop was Hemagiri Waterfalls, which was 30 minutes away from the lake. We reached the place at 2::40 PM.
it was a small waterfall and a overflowing lake on the right side. 
there was a 6feet way to walke aruond the lake. quite a peaceful moment.
we clicked some photos and left the place at 3:30 PM.
We planned to go to mysure as well by after checking woth our zoomcar host, we got to know that we wont be able to extend the booking since the car was already booked by someone else. So we decided
to head back to bangalore.

this time shuchita drove the car. we took the mysuru expressway.
We reached bangalore at 6:30 PM.
