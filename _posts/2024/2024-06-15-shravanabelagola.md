It had been a while since I last visited Shravanabelagola. Someone in our Gyanoday group mentioned they wanted to visit the place and were looking for company. On the same day, four of us connected over WhatsApp and decided to go on a road trip to see Bahubali’s statue.

We booked a Zoomcar for the trip. I received the car at 4:30 AM and began picking up the group—first Shuchita, then Saloni, and finally another friend near Marathahalli. By the time we left Bangalore, it was already 6:30 AM.


On our way, we stopped for breakfast at Sambharam, a restaurant near the highway. We had idli, dosa, and tea. The food was delicious, and the service was quick. By 7:30 AM, we were back on the road.


I drove the entire way since I was the only one comfortable driving. Though Shuchita knew how to drive, she preferred not to at that moment. We reached Shravanabelagola at 9:00 AM. I quickly parked the car, and we started climbing the hill. By 9:30 AM, we reached the temple.

Visiting Bahubali’s statue is always a unique experience—no matter how many times I see it, it feels like the first time. The grandeur and serenity of the place make every problem in life seem insignificant. We spent some time there, even video-calling my parents to give them a virtual darshan. At 11:00 AM, we left the temple and explored some nearby temples as well.

Since we had time before heading back, we decided to visit Kikkeri Kere, a lake nearby, and a waterfall in the vicinity. The drive was scenic, with lush green roads forming a beautiful canopy overhead. We couldn’t resist stopping to click some photos.

We reached Kikkeri Kere around 1:30 PM. Unfortunately, the lake was a bit underwhelming, so we searched Google Maps for a better spot. We found a narrow road cutting through the middle of the lake and decided to check it out. The path was just wide enough for a single car, with water on both sides. It was an incredible sight. We turned on some music, enjoyed the breeze, and took several photos before leaving at 2:00 PM.

Our next stop was Hemagiri Waterfalls, about 30 minutes away. We arrived at 2:40 PM. The waterfall was small but charming, and there was an overflowing lake beside it. A narrow six-foot-wide walkway led around the lake, making for a peaceful and refreshing stroll. We clicked a few more photos and left around 3:30 PM.


Initially, we planned to visit Mysore as well, but after checking with our Zoomcar host, we realized we couldn’t extend the booking since the car was already reserved by someone else. So, we decided to head back to Bangalore.

This time, Shuchita took the wheel, and we cruised along the Mysuru Expressway. We reached Bangalore by 6:30 PM, marking the end of an eventful and refreshing trip.

Overall, it was a day well spent—good company, scenic drives, and beautiful destinations. Looking forward to the next adventure!
