Sometimes, the best way to spend a weekend is by reconnecting with nature and challenging oneself. That's exactly what we decided to do â€“ embark on a trek to Asia's largest monolith hill, a perfect weekend escape from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore.


Our trekking team consisted of Sudhanshu, Ujjwal, Umakant, Anmol, Prakhar, and me. The initial plan was to start our journey at 6 AM, but as it often happens, we got a bit delayed and finally hit the road by 7 AM.

The Journey Begins
We took five bikes to reach the base of the hill. Since the area is a reserved forest, we had to book our tickets online through the Karnataka Eco Tourism website. The cost was 300 INR per person, which we found reasonable considering the experience that awaited us.

Upon reaching the base, we parked our bikes and found a small snack shop nearby. The shop owner kindly offered to keep our helmets, heavy jackets, and bags for free, which was a great relief.

After a brief stop at the snack shop, we moved to the starting point of the trek, where a security guard checked our tickets. Soon, a guide joined us to lead the way. The trek began easily enough, but it didn't take long for the trail to become steeper and more challenging.

We took several breaks along the way, capturing the scenic beauty with our cameras. The importance of staying hydrated during a trek cannot be overstated, and we were well-prepared with several water bottles. Anmol, in particular, was our savior with his duffel bag full of snacks and extra water.


As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the heat intensified, making the trek more taxing. Despite the increasing temperature, the beautiful landscape kept us motivated. The view from the top was absolutely breathtaking, making every bit of effort worth it.


Trekking Asia's largest monolith hill was an unforgettable experience. It was a perfect mix of adventure, camaraderie, and natural beauty. If you're looking for a weekend getaway from Bangalore that offers both a physical challenge and stunning vistas, this trek is definitely worth considering. Just remember to book your tickets in advance, pack plenty of water, and bring along good friends to share the journey with.
