Who doesn't like adventure sports? I have always been a fan of them, but I never thought I would do a bungee jump, especially from the second highest point in the world. The jump was from 228 meters.

Me, Om, and Shantanu were in Nepal for a week, and this was on our bucket list. Once we reached Pokhara, we booked a taxi to take us to the bungee location, which was 70 kilometers away and took us three hours to reach. On the way, we saw beautiful landscapes, rivers, and even the Annapurna range. We took a couple of breaks to click pictures and enjoy the view. I had a GoPro with me, recording the whole journey. My stomach was churning with excitement and fear; I wanted to do it, but I was also scared. However, having come this far, I had to go through with it.

We reached the cliff where the organization managing the bungee jump was located. The entry to the bungee location was through a hanging bridge. At the entry, we did our registration and weight check. The Nepali receptionists were very cute and friendly, making us feel comfortable. We chatted with them, and they told us they had been doing this for years. We packed our bags, kept them in the locker, and headed towards the bridge.

Walking towards the jump point was thrilling. The bridge was hanging over a river, and the jump was from the bridge, which connected two mountains forming a 300-meter deep valley. Almost in the middle of the valley was the jump point. Initially, walking on the rope bridge was scary, but as we reached the middle, it wasn't that scary, and the view was getting better and better. The jump point was a small platform with eight guys managing the jump.

We were in the first batch, so as a customary practice, one of the instructors jumped first to check the rope and the entire setup. Nobody had ever died here, but it was still a good practice. He showed some stunts while going down. Om was the first one to jump; he was excited and scared at the same time. Watching people jump from the bridge was also thrilling. The jump was so fast that it was over in a blink of an eye.

It was my turn now. I was scared but also excited. They tied a camera on my hand and did some pre-checks. The harness was tight, and I was placed near the edge of the platform. When I looked down from the jumping point, my blood froze, and I felt my heart skip a beat. Zero thoughts, just the feeling of falling. When you can see your death, you feel alive. I knew the harness would save me, but the feeling of falling was still there. The instructor said some motivational words to make me feel comfortable, but I wasn't listening; I was just looking down. Then I thought, I have come so far; I'm not going to back out now. I took a deep breath and jumped.

Oh boy, the feeling of free-falling was amazing. The wind was gushing through my hair, and the view was spectacular. The adrenaline rush was real. I was falling at 120 km/h. The fall lasted for 3-4 seconds but felt like eternity. I was screaming, shouting, laughing, and crying all at the same time. The feeling of falling was so amazing that I wanted to do it again. The jump lasted 8-9 seconds before the rope pulled me back up. It is an elastic rope, so I was bouncing up and down for some time. Since you fall upside down, the valley with the river at the bottom looked even more beautiful.

Then I opened my eyes and saw the camera, doing some vlogging. They pulled me back up, and I was so happy that I did it. I was so proud of myself. Best 10k spent so far. It took me some time to realize that I did it. I went out of the jump platform. Since Om and I were done, we started clicking pictures. Being overweight, Shantanu was last in the queue. We went to get snacks and drinks. Shantanu also did the jump, and it was fun. We were so happy that we did it. We took some more pictures and then left for Pokhara.
