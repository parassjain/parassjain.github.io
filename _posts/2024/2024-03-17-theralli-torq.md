There was a bike ride happening for Royal Enfield riders, especially for Hunter riders. Arun had recently bought a Hunter and was excited to participate in the ride. I joined Arun as a pillion rider. We started from the Royal Enfield showroom in Whitefield. There were 20-25 riders in total. We left around 6:30 from the showroom. The weather was good, and the ride was smooth.

We stopped on our way to have breakfast at Swathi Hotel and Cafe. It was a typical South Indian breakfast with idli, vada, dosa, etc. While we were there, we saw a big group of bikers arrive at the same restaurant. The surroundings roared with the sound of bikesâ€”Harley Davidsons, Ducatis, and other liter-class bikes. I saw a Ducati Panigale V4, a Kawasaki ZX10R, the mighty Hayabusa, some vintage Kawasaki 14XRs, and many more. I got so excited to see all these bikes and clicked pictures of all of them.

We left the restaurant around 8:30. Our destination was nearby, Theralli View Point, which we reached in about 15 minutes. The viewpoint was mostly a pile of big stones. Everyone went ahead with the guide while Arun and I climbed a hill of stones, reached the top, and clicked some pictures there. Then we came down and went to the viewpoint. There were some caves as well.

We met our group, who were returning from the caves. They told us not to go to the caves without a guide. Ignoring their advice, we ventured into the caves, which were narrow and dusty. At some points, we had to crawl to go further. Eventually, we decided it wasn't worth it and came back. We went back to the viewpoint and clicked some more pictures. Then, we started our journey back to Bangalore.

Later in the evening, I went to Torq with other friends from the office. We did bowling, go-karting, and some other games. The most fun was had during go-karting.
