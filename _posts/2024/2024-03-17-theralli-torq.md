- we met our group which was returning from the caves.
- they told us not to go to the caves without a guide.
- we ignored and went to the caves, those were narrow and dusty.
- at some point we had to crawl to go further. then we decided it's not worth it and came back.
- we went to the view point, clicked some pics there.
- then we started our journey back to bangalore.
