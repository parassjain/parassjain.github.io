Surfing in Chennai: An Adventure at Kovalam Beach with Surf Turf

It was the beginning of April, and Bangalore was getting warmer by the day. That‚Äôs when Om, my friend who lives in Chennai, texted me. "What are you up to this weekend? Any plans?" I had nothing lined up‚Äîno bike rides, no treks. Then he asked, "Want to come to Chennai for surfing? There‚Äôs a good surf club near Kovalam Beach, just 20 km from the city."

Mohit was busy, but I was up for a new adventure. Surfing was something I had never tried before, so I decided to take an overnight bus from Bangalore to Chennai for the weekend.

Arrival in Chennai

This was my first time visiting Chennai in about a year. We reached early in the morning, and as expected, the weather was humid. Having lived in Mumbai, I was familiar with the coastal climate, but Chennai felt even more intense. After reaching, we headed to Om‚Äôs place, where he had been staying for a while.

That evening, we did nothing major‚Äîjust explored Chennai, visited some random spots, and tried local food. While Om was familiar with the city, it was all new to me, so we spent the time wandering around.

Surfing at Kovalam Beach

Surfing sessions start early in the morning, around 6 AM to 9 AM, because that‚Äôs when the waves are at their best, and the sun isn‚Äôt scorching yet. Once it gets past 9 AM, the heat becomes unbearable. Since Chennai is on the eastern coast, we also got to witness the sunrise over the horizon.

We booked a cab around 5:30 AM and reached Kovalam Beach in about 30 minutes. As we arrived at Surf Turf, we saw the sun peeking over the water, casting a golden-orange glow across the sky.

At first, we weren‚Äôt sure who to talk to, but soon an instructor approached us. After a brief introduction, he informed us that the session would begin shortly. The experienced surfers there looked like pros‚Äîmuscular and confident, as if they had been riding waves since childhood.

We were given surfboards and a quick lesson on paddling, balancing, and standing up. This land-based training lasted about 30 minutes. Then, it was time to hit the water.

Hitting the Waves

Our coach kept repeating, "Paddle, paddle, paddle, and stand up!" We had to practice this over and over, around 30 times before we were allowed to go deeper. Finally, we started catching small waves, trying to balance and glide on the water.

For nearly two hours, we struggled, fell, and got back up. It was an incredible learning curve‚Äîfrom knowing absolutely nothing to at least managing to stand up for a few seconds on a floating board. The experience was thrilling, exhausting, and rewarding all at once.

Wrapping Up the Session

By the time the session ended, we were completely drained. Even carrying our surfboards back to the rack felt like a task. After settling the payment, we booked another session for the next day. The coaches were friendly and patient, making the learning process smooth and enjoyable.

Breakfast and Exploring

After surfing, I realized I hadn‚Äôt packed an extra T-shirt, and my only one was completely soaked. On our way to breakfast at Adyar Anand Bhavan, we passed through a small village market where Om picked up a random T-shirt for me. It was cheap, comfortable, and I‚Äôm still wearing it!

Breakfast at Adyar Anand Bhavan was an experience in itself. The place was packed, almost like people were getting free food. We finally managed to grab a table and devoured some dosas, idlis, and vadas, along with fresh juices. The food was delicious, and the energy of the place was infectious.

Evening Stroll and Midnight at the Beach

In the evening, we wandered around Decathlon, buying random stuff. Later, we took a walk along the coast near Om‚Äôs place, enjoying the cool breeze and grabbing some ice cream from a local shop.

At midnight, we headed to the beach. The moonlight reflected beautifully on the ocean, and we just sat there, listening to the waves. The night breeze, the sound of the sea, and the peaceful atmosphere made it a perfect way to end the day.

More Surfing and Final Thoughts

The next morning, we had another incredible session at Surf Turf. This time, we bonded more with the coaches, all from Tamil Nadu, and watched professional surfers effortlessly ride the waves. Some of them performed jumps and tricks, making it look like an art form.

Overall, surfing in Chennai was an amazing experience. From struggling to stand up on the board to finally catching small waves, it was a journey of learning and fun. Kovalam Beach and Surf Turf provided the perfect introduction to the sport, and I can‚Äôt wait to do it again!
