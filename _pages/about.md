I consider myself an avid adventurer, constantly venturing into diverse landscapes to capture the breathtaking beauty of nature. 🏞️ Whether on two wheels as a passionate biker 🏍️, riding the waves as a surfer 🏄‍♂️, gliding through water as a swimmer 🏊‍♂️, or engaging in intense badminton matches 🏸, I thrive on the thrill of exploration.

By profession, I am a software engineer 👩‍💻, but my true calling lies in being a dedicated traveler ✈️. The allure of discovering new places has taken me across various regions in India 🇮🇳, where I’ve immersed myself in numerous treks 🏔️ and adventurous activities. Solo travel is a particular joy for me, as it allows me to connect with people 🤝 and share the awe-inspiring moments I capture in nature 📸.

Graduating from IIT Bombay in 2021 with a specialization in Chemical Engineering 🎓, I discovered my passion for AI and computer science 💻 during my college years. Recognizing the excitement and intrigue they held, I delved into learning about AI, eventually leading me to embark on a journey into the realm of artificial intelligence 🤖.

My travel journey truly kicked off after college 🎓, coinciding with the beginning of my career 👩‍💻, which conveniently allowed me to work from home 🏡. Over the past two years, I’ve traversed numerous states in India 🇮🇳, creating a mosaic of experiences and memories 🧳. Most of my journeys have been shared adventures with different friends 👫, while some have been solo expeditions 🚶‍♀️, each offering a unique perspective on the beauty and diversity our country has to offer 🌍.

Lately, I've embarked on bike trips 🏍️, primarily focusing on destinations within a 300-kilometer radius of Bangalore 🗺️, making them perfect for day trips ☀️. This newfound exploration on two wheels has proven to be the ultimate way to discover the hidden gems 💎 and scenic wonders 🏞️ in the vicinity of Bangalore. The freedom of the open road allows me to soak in the beauty of the surroundings and experience the charm of places that are easily accessible for a quick getaway 🚀. It's a delightful journey of discovery right in the backyard of Bangalore 🌳.
